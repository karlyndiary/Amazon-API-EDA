I have one attached to my keys, another in my briefcase, one in my wallet, another on my dog's collar, and one in my suitcase. The latter paid for itself in spades a couple of weeks ago when my luggage was ""misplaced"" by the airline for nearly 5 days. The AirTag allowed me to tell the airline that no, my bag was not anywhere near Las Vegas....in fact, they sent it on an all expense paid trip to Alabama! It was really awesome to be able to show the baggage agent EXACTLY where my bag wound up. In this case, it was invaluable as the airline baggage agent put someone else's tag on my bag.

AirTags are wonderful little gadgets...if you have an iPhone. The batteries last around a year and are easily replaced with inexpensive CR2023 batteries. They're small, work great, and although they are a bit expensive, they can be invaluable. The only thing to remember is that they only work if someone with an iPhone passes by them within Bluetooth range, which is around 15 feet. So if you lose it on a mountain top somewhere, it's probably not going to be very useful. Otherwise...they're awesome!",5,B0CWXNS552,2024-08-27,Positive

What I love most about the AirTag is its accuracy and reliability. The Find My app on my iPhone lets me see exactly where my dog is at all times. If he ever wanders off, I can quickly locate him, which is especially reassuring during walks in unfamiliar areas or when visiting busy parks.

Another fantastic feature is the Precision Finding, which helps me pinpoint his location down to the exact spot. The AirTag even plays a sound to help me find him if he's hiding nearby. Plus, with the vast network of Apple devices, even if he gets far away, the AirTag can still be tracked by other iPhones in the area.

Overall, the AirTag has become an essential tool in keeping my dog safe. I highly recommend it to any pet owner who wants a reliable way to ensure their furry friend's safety and security.",5,B0CWXNS552,2024-08-28,Positive

I've had them on my dogs for over a year now, but never really had to use them until recently. One of my dogs is a 13-year-old Yorkie/Bichon who is deaf, and has heart-issues; He is severely frightened by fireworks. We recently had tornadoes that damaged the fences in our yard, but we were not aware that he could actually exit the yard through the neighbors yard because their fence was damaged on the opposite side as well. On the 4th of July, we let our dogs out to use the bathroom, and seeing and feeling the vibrations of the fireworks, he got scared and ran off. We searched for him for hours, following the air tags location, but he kept moving. Finally the location stopped; he was in a home a few blocks away. We went to the house, but of course they lied and said he was not there. We pleaded with them to give him to us, due to his health issues and medication he needed, but they continued to deny his presence. We called the police of course, because we knew they were lying! I guess, since they couldn't figure out how we were able to track him to their home, they just let him go back out into the street about about 20 minutes later. Another hour and a half later, we found him hiding behind a flower pot on the next block. If it were for the accuracy of this Air Tag, we probably never would've got my fur baby back home! I am so happy I invested in it!

Sorry for the long story, but the bottom line is, if you love and cherish your fur babies like I do, it should be a no-brainer! Get an Air Tag! Especially if you have breeds that are highly coveted and prone to being taken and not returned. Microchips are worthless; they only help if someone actually returns your pet to the Humane Society or something. Don't depend on the off-chance that your pet is turned in by a good Samaritan. In 2024, unfortunately, there aren't many anymore :-(",5,B0CWXNS552,2024-07-18,Negative

The setup process was incredibly easy—literally took just a few minutes to get everything up and running.

The versatility of the AirTags is remarkable. These compact trackers can be attached to just about anything, from our dogs’ collars to our backpacks and even our boat. Their small size means they don’t add bulk or interfere with the aesthetics of the items they’re tracking.

One thing to keep in mind is that while the AirTags themselves are durable, you’ll definitely want to invest in cases or holders for them. This helps protect them from wear and tear and ensures they stay securely attached to whatever you’re tracking.

The battery life is impressive as well. The AirTags last a long time between battery changes, which is very convenient and adds to their overall value. Additionally, the location accuracy in suburban areas is spot-on. We’ve been able to locate our dogs, backpacks, and boat with ease, thanks to the precise tracking capabilities.

The sound reproduction is superb, great bass, incredible for such tiny things, and the battery lasted all work day with listening to music/getting on zoom meetings.  I also tested putting one earbud into the case at a time and they both kept up great individually and transferred to the other earbud seamlessly.  The earbuds are shaped different than the ones I'm used to, there is no replaceable rubber attachment to jam into your ear, just plastic.  They are shaped very much like earbuds that rhymes with ""sapple sair spod"", so I had to ask my coworkers and friends because the earbuds feel very loose, like they could fall out easily, but they said that's how ""sapple sair spod""s are.  I have to admit they have not fallen out yet, but I have reached up to adjust them and accidentally started playing a tune or skipped a song a few times.  Originally I docked Comfort one star because they feel loose, but added it back as it may just be I'm not used to wearing this kind of earbud.  Another thing I realized after a day's work, is that where my ear might normally feel like I need a break (they were itchy), with these earbuds I did not have that issue.  The controls are comparable to others, you tap, double tap, or long press for various functions such as volume up/down/skip back/forward/pause/play.

This is hands down the best phone holder I’ve purchased—simple, effective, and well-designed. The kit includes a cleaning pad to prep the area where you’ll stick the holder, along with clear instructions. I use it with a Note 20 5G, a pretty large and heavy phone with its case, and it holds up really well.

My favorite feature is the easy-release button at the back. It’s a breeze to use compared to other holders I’ve tried, which had cumbersome clips that required two hands to open.

It would work for a little bit but eventually the whole thing would just detach from the vent and fall on the floor of the car while I was driving. Not good.  This phone holder was the first one I tried that ever actually worked for a larger heavy phone. It was extremely easy to assemble and attached easily to the top of my dashboard. Yesterday I took a long (5 hour) drive out of state on lots of bumpy roads and the phone holder really held extremely well and gave me no problems at all.  It stayed in place throughout the ride. I am very happy with this product and recommended to anyone with a large or heavy phone.,5,B0CHS69JW3,2024-08-24,Positive

Then finaly i put my phone in and it looks perfect. then I get into drive and it falls right off the dashboard. The next day i take off the plate and just apply the suction sticky to the windsheild and it has worked perfectly since.

But with the recent heat wave, the phone tends to get hotter than usual and CarPlay seems to drop out due to the phone overheating. I decided to test this out and see if it will help, and it did.

First would be the mounting options. You can use the bare suction cup to stick it to your windshield which is what I did. The mount was secure for our whole 3-hr trip with the occasional bumpy roads. You can extend the mount forward but due to physics, the phone will be shaky. They also provide you a mounting plate if you want to stick it on your dashboard.

There’s a space at the bottom of the mount so you can route your charger, so charging isn’t an issue. I normally prefer a wireless charger but that generates extra heat which is what I am trying to avoid.

As for the price, you can compare this to a popular brand like iOttie which costs triple and performs similarly as well. I prefer keeping it cheap. They look similar too aside from the brand. There’s also a 1 press button to release the phone clamp.

I can’t really say anything negative on the mount. So far it’s a good value for money.",5,B0D6R7ZR5P,2024-07-27,Neutral

Without this kit it will be a possibility of being completely incorrect and the order will be useless and it will be a headache to have to immediately return the ring and then wait for the support team to replace it for the correct size and then it's likely to be another incorrect size and so it is obvious that the kit is paramount.

The ease of use of the kit is perfect and easy to find the perfect size within a matter of minutes and then you will wear the sample for 24 hours and verify the fit with the suggestions to understand the protocols that they require for the fit and functionality to be perfectly suited for the user. The value of the kit is so much more than the period of time of the process of using it prior to the purchase.

Enter the AirPods Pro—an extraordinary improvement in every way. The first thing that struck me was the sound quality. It's a massive leap from the original AirPods, offering rich, deep bass that adds a new dimension to my favorite tracks. The highs are beautifully crisp, bringing out details in music that I hadn't noticed before.

Another standout feature is the noise cancellation. Whether I'm on a noisy commute or in a crowded café, the AirPods Pro do an impressive job of muting the background noise, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the audio experience. The transparency mode is equally impressive, seamlessly letting in outside sounds when needed without having to remove the earbuds.

The fit of the AirPods Pro is another significant upgrade. The customizable ear tips make them much more comfortable for extended wear, and they stay secure even during workouts. I never had that with the original AirPods, which would occasionally slip out.

Battery life is solid, and the wireless charging case is a convenient bonus. The overall build quality feels premium, with a sleek design that continues the minimalist aesthetic Apple is known for.

In short, the AirPods Pro have exceeded my expectations in every way. They’re a must-have for anyone looking to elevate their audio experience, whether you’re upgrading from the original AirPods or new to the Apple ecosystem. Highly recommended.",5,B0D1XD1ZV3,2024-08-29,Positive

I had the AirPods Pro Gen1 prior to these, but the new AirPods blew them out of the water. The added ear tips make customability even better especially for small ears like mine.

The Active Noise Cancellation is clearly superior to the first generation and the addition of Adaptive audio is super cool and very useful.

The battery is even better than I was expecting. The AirPods charge super fast in the case, and the case charging itself is also super fast. The USB-C cord is a very nice addition especially with the new, more common, USB-C charging block. The new Apple Braided USB-C cord is also a small but nice touch.

I personally do not use the ring on the side, but I imagine many people may find it useful. The addition of the Find My capabilities with both the case and the AirPods themselves is beyond helpful because I always seem to misplace them. Small bonus, every time you charge the case or the AirPods, the case sounds off a little chime to let you know that they are charging or if the battery is low.

As an owner of the AirPods Max and a former owner of the AirPods Pro gen 1, I would 100% recommend this new generation. The noise cancellation is superior to the gen 1, but slightly behind the Maxes because they are in-ear instead of over-ear. If you want the maxes, I would get them, but it depends on your activities. The AirPods Pro are ideal because they are small, descrete, and light weight. You can slip them in your pocket or place just one in your ear. They are also very useful and comfortable to use while working out, as opposed to the maxes.

The AirPods are quite durable too. If my first pair is any indication to this pair, then I promise you, they can take a beating. After 4 years of having the first gen AirPods Pro, I have thrown them around, dropped them hundreds of times and they often got small scratches, but only chipped once or twice after higher falls on super hard surfaces. But they worked every single time.

Long story short, if you’re on the fence, get them. They are super great for travel, workouts/runs, house chores, and all activities in general.

Hope you find this helpful, if you have any questions please comment them!",5,B0D1XD1ZV3,2024-08-09,Positive

The differences are immediately noticeable, with a richer, more immersive audio experience courtesy of the new H2 chip. The noise cancellation has been significantly improved, providing up to 2x better performance in blocking out ambient noise. This is a game-changer, especially when I'm using them during my bike rides or other active pursuits.

One of the most practical upgrades is the ability to easily adjust the volume directly on the earbuds themselves. This simple yet effective addition has made a substantial difference in my daily use, allowing me to quickly fine-tune the audio without needing to reach for my connected device.

Another feature I've come to appreciate is the speaker built into the charging case. As someone who tends to misplace things, this has been a lifesaver, making it much easier to locate my AirPods Pro when they inevitably get lost in my bag or around the house.

The customizable fit remains a standout feature, with the included silicone tips allowing me to achieve a secure, comfortable seal that effectively blocks out external noise. The overall dust, sweat, and water resistance also provide peace of mind when using these earbuds in more active environments.

While the price tag is still on the premium side, the 2nd generation AirPods Pro deliver a truly exceptional audio experience that justifies the investment. The combination of improved noise cancellation, volume controls, and the handy charging case speaker make this a worthy upgrade for anyone seeking the best-in-class true wireless earbuds.",5,B0D1XD1ZV3,2024-08-08,Positive

This product is the Airpods Pro ""version 2"". It took me a while to convince myself to buy these, but after testing both side-by-side I noticed a few very noticeable features.

*ANC is improved. I can say this with certainty. I work hobbies that at times involve loud machinery and fellas yelling at each other. I can tell the difference in the ANC ""level"". It simply works better than before and it has this additional thing that detects vocal conversations and adapts- the V1 pros didn't have that.

*Sound quality is minorly improved - I have pretty good ears, and the bass sounds a bit better with these. Unfortunately, that's about all I can say about that.

*Battery and compatibility vastly improved; USB-C Charging has been long overdue. The wireless charging works better than v1 too- v1 heats up quite a bit and seems to charge endlessly using the official wireless apple charger. V2 doesn't have that issue. The batteries in the case and pods are nearly 2x better from what I am seeing so far.

*Quality hasn't declined; This one is important to me. I buy apple products mainly because of their build quality and how well they operate with each other. These pair nearly effortlessly with the iPhone, and the FindMy function has VASTLY improved; Making the case able to produce a sound to locate with has been a game changer. Previously with the older Airpod Pros, if you lost them while in the case, you couldn't locate them with the find-my app because they had no way to produce a noise whilst in the case. I am so glad they improved upon this quality aspect and the Airpod's quality continues to rise without noticeable compromises.

*AppleCare+: Nothing has really changed about this and that's a good thing. AppleCare+ works well, and I recommend it. I use it on all of my apple devices. I was happy to see that they made it even easier than before to get AppleCare+ bundled with the actual purchase of the airpods. Before, you had to manually activate it and that was a bit inconvienent. Plus people would forget they had AppleCare and leave their device unprotected because they didn't activate it. Glad to hear they addressed all that as well.

*Lasting technology: My final point is most important to me. I could ramble on and on about this part but long story short- I use these ALL the time, and I'm not joking- around 60-75% of the time I have these in, even without music playing. If you're the type of person who uses these a lot, then going from V1 to V2 is a no-brainer. But if you do NOT use them constantly like I do, don't worry! That's probably good for you and if you're not tethered to them like I am, then you should probably wait for the newer ""v3"" ones that are coming out sometime next year.

The Airpod Pro's v2 might not be an impressive upgrade for audiophiles, but for almost everyone else the extra bells & whistles make up for the marginally improved sound quality and make it worth the extra cost.",5,B0D1XD1ZV3,2024-07-20,Positive

All Apple all the time, the way everything works together just makes the part of my brain that demands product harmony feel good. But I have never been an earbuds guy. I’ve been a regular AirPods guy, specifically not the Pros.

I didn’t like things sticking in my ear, I’d never found one that works. And stupidly, my stupid reason for trying these is because of the USB C/Magsafe charging case because I’m trying to phase out my Lightning-charging devices. Guys I am unwell, okay? But stick with me a moment here. I also liked that the case is trackable in Find My along with the pods themselves, I’ve become a big Find My guy recently so that tickles my fancy.

So anyway I bought a pair of 3rd gen AirPods and they’re very good but largely the same as my old 2nds. So I figured hey, I’ll try the Pro 2s and worst case I return them.

I will not be returning them.

Popped em in, did the setup, and some of this is because I’ve never had good noise cancelling headphones but I was sitting 7 feet from my furnace earlier and could not hear the fan. Popped one out, hella loud fan. Back in, silence. Witchcraft, sorcery.

Sound quality is fabulous, I’m listening to Mint Jams by Casiopea right now because of that Reddit meme about the guy buying a record from Japan and it sounds so great. Holy Diver by Dio kicks ass, Kickstart My Heart puts your head right in Tommy Lee’s…drum kit. You could tell me they’re not audiophile quality or whatever and I’m sure you’re right but songs I’ve heard 1000 times sound like so much more wearing these.

It also comes with four different size eartips, and what I’ve discovered about myself is my problem has been with the size of them. Medium didn’t feel like they were in all the way. Small was a little better, went down to extra small and I can finally wear in-ear earbuds. Ordered two replacement sets because I can see where white eartips might get gross quickly.

So anyway, buy these AirPods. Connection is seamless with your Apple devices. They work great, they look good if you like AirPods. I find them very comfortable, battery life is probably fine but I haven’t gotten that far yet. Apple ropes me successfully into another part of their ecosystem, c’est la vie.",5,B0D1XD1ZV3,2024-07-30,Positive

They were really good compared to the original AirPods. I was going to wait to upgrade from the first gen pros to these second gen pros, but they were on sale for the cheapest I’ve seen, so I didn’t want to wait and never see that price again. The battery life on these is amazing. Especially in comparison to my aging first gen pros. They actually run down to 0%, rather than dying while at ~38% like my first gen pros. I also love how you can adjust the volume with the actual AirPods by swiping up and down on the stem. It’s super cool! Very convenient for when my phone’s charging somewhere away from me, or I just can’t get to it. I like that the case makes a sound when you plug it in to charge, so I know it’s actually charging. I think that the noise cancelling is better than the first gen pros, but sometimes with only one AirPod in I feel like the volume isn’t loud enough. Maybe that’s just me, but it’s a little annoying because I don’t want to turn my volume up too much. Anyway, these are a lot better than the first gen pros. Like, by far.

I found using Siri overcame using the controls. “Siri volume up.  Siri answer call. “

The trifecta.","I travel for a living, and mostly use my device for listening to audiobooks and music. I had been gifted, by my brother, a pair of Studio Beats which I liked, but got mixed reviews from others when taking phone calls. In fact, my brother was the harshest critic, so when he suggested these Airpods Pro 2 were on sale, I placed an order.

My expectations were low. The only earbuds that stay in my ears are the neckband style and the corded tapered Apple style that used to come with iPhones. Because I am often (even mostly) in loud industrial environments, a lack of volume is another frequent problem for me.

But, not to worry!

I was reading about the features and controls as I opened the package and got them in my ears, when my iPhone connected to them, and immediately began playing my music. It happened to be Stevie Ray Vaughan playing *The House is Rockin'* and I was overwhelmed.  The volume was excellent, as was the sound.  Second greatest fear of disappointment obliterated. Now excited, I, none the less, had to let Stevie Ray finish Rockin', because, well, it was Stevie Ray.

Making no adjustment to the fitted earpiece, the AirPods have not fallen out once-- something my Beats could not have managed to do for so long a time and with such activity. I have had them about 24 hours and with moderate-to-heavy use. Simply walking would cause my beats to fall out, no matter what fitting I used.

Moments ago, I completed the main test with a phone call with my Hi-Fi critic brother. Yesterday on the phone, wearing my Studio Beats, I went down carpeted stairs which only creaked softly, but he commented on the loud banging sound he was hearing-- like doors slamming.  Today, with my AirPods Pro 2, I walked about on the hardwood floors, microwaved my coffee in the kitchen, and went back to my bedroom, and then asked him about what background noise he has heard. ""I haven't heard anything. Try moving around some.""

When I told him I had been, we were both very pleased. That was the final test.

These are the best BlueTooth audio devices I have ever had-- and I have paid more than this for some very good ones.

The noise cancelling is stunning-- almost eerie. I am not used to being in such a quiet environment. Just switched from ""Adaptive"" mode to ""Noise Cancellation"" as a big truck went by. Sound went to zero. My air conditioning and street noise (I live downtown) utterly go away by switching from ""Transparency"" to ""Noise Cancellation.""

A cool feature I had to turn OFF is ""Conversation Awareness,"" although I will probably want to make some use of it. The problem is, when I listen to music, I often sing along, and doing so with that feature enabled, quiets the music. My AirPods are not the first to complain about my singing, but perhaps the most subtle in doing so. I don't really blame them.

Everything else is at default settings, and I am most pleased with these.

Small thing, but useful to me: The case is designed for adding a wrist or neck strap. I'm buying it a nice neck-strap. I want these with me.",5,B0D1XD1ZV3,2024-07-20,Positive

There are no downsides, and every feature works perfectly..

Features? There's a lot! The sound / noise cancelation works better than any other headphone or ear bud I've ever tried. Want to know what it's like to be deaf? Turn it on. Just don't forget it's on, you'll hear nothing!  Touch controls are useful to control your content, take calls, or stop/start movies without touching the device. Best feature, transparency mode! Not only is this frequency response adjustable (EQ), and amplification controllable, but can also be used as a hearing aid!.. Yes, it's true, as I've used this and it actually works better than $8000 hearing aids (in every possible way).  Another cool feature is you can charge the case on a wireless charging pad, like mag safe. Just throw it on the charger, and in about an hour, you're case and AirPods (if they're in the case) are charged.  They also work with any bluetooth sound. Just press the button on the side of the case to pair, and it won't interfere when you go back to your phone or iPad, connects right away again.

The Bluetooth connectivity is second to none! Bring it near the iPhone, and it instantly connects, then need to switch to iPad, connects to that again. The range is very good too. For me, it works through out the house. This beats carrying your cell phone around to not miss a text or call. Text come is, and Siri will announce it to you.

Battery life is very good, nearly 6 hours and they recharge fast.

Comfort is good, the buds are lightweight too. They do tend to fall out of my ears, but that's my problem, not a fault of the device.

Sound quality is excellent. Although disclaimer, I have some hearing loss, so hard to judge this. I used to be a professional sound engineer, and from what hearing I have left, I can tell you they Apple nailed it!  Some advice: don't become a sound engineer if you wish to have normal hearing after age 35.

Design and form factor. Again, second to none. Seems like everyone copied Apple on design, but Apple keeps leading. The case is beautiful and elegant. The magnetic closure holds the lid down, and holds the buds in the case sockets. Has one USB C port on the bottom for easy connections.  Also has a lanyard loop (which I think is the Bluetooth antenna too).  The rubber ear pieces are easy to remove and a great design.

Function, no bugs I can find, and if there are any I find them!  No software upgrades needed.

Like I said, these are the GOAT. If you have an iPhone or iPad, or Mac, these are a must have product. If you need noise cancelation, take calls in noisy areas, these are the ones too. Highly recommended.",5,B0D1XD1ZV3,2024-08-20,Positive

I never thought I'd say this about a piece of Amazon Tech, but for numerous reasons, the Firestick TV 4k has quickly become my favorite cloud gaming console, and here's why:

1. I bought it on Prime Day for $29. It's $59 full price. And even at full price, it is by far the cheapest device capable of cloud gaming.

2. Fire TV has apps for Playstation, XBOX and Luna, which support MOST popular games. Sadly, Rocket League and Minecraft have not made the cut. But the free games included with Luna are still better than the free games on most other platforms I've used.

3. The Firestick 4k's interface is much smoother and faster than my other consoles. My Nvidia Shield in particular has a clunky, slow interface. The Firestick puts other interfaces to shame.

4. The firestick 4k boots games faster than my other consoles. It appears to perform better than the XBOX One during gameplay, but not quite on par with the Nvidia Shield TV Pro (which is to be expected).

4. XBOX, Playstation, Switch Pro, Luna, 8BitDo, and almost every 3rd Part controller will pair to the Firestick easily from the settings menu. Connected controllers automatically turn on when turning on the TV using the Firestick remote which is another cool little feature.

The Firestick 4k is proof that cloud gaming can be fast, easy, and incredibly affordable. For under $100, you can get this streaming stick and a top notch controller. That's nuts. If Amazon scores more developers and more popular titles to add to the Luna library, I can easily see Amazon becoming a real competitor in cloud gaming.",5,B0CJM1GNFQ,2024-07-22,Positive

Here’s my detailed review:

**Pros:**

1. **4K Ultra HD Streaming:** The picture quality is stunning. With support for 4K Ultra HD, Dolby Vision, HDR, and HDR10+, the visuals are crisp and vibrant, making movies and TV shows incredibly immersive.

2. **Extensive Content Library:** With access to over 1.5 million movies and TV episodes, there’s never a shortage of things to watch. The availability of various streaming services like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, and more, all in one place, is highly convenient.

3. **Wi-Fi 6 Support:** The inclusion of Wi-Fi 6 ensures a faster and more stable internet connection, especially in households with multiple devices. Streaming is smooth with minimal buffering, even in 4K resolution.

4. **Voice Remote with Alexa:** The voice remote featuring Alexa is a game-changer. It allows for easy navigation, quick searches, and even smart home control. Just ask Alexa to find, launch, and control content, or check the weather and control compatible smart home devices.

5. **Easy Setup and User-Friendly Interface:** Setting up the Fire TV Stick 4K was a breeze. The interface is intuitive, making it easy to navigate through apps and settings. The new Live View Picture-in-Picture feature is also handy for keeping an eye on security cameras while watching TV.

6. **Free and Live TV Options:** The ability to watch free and live TV channels is a fantastic addition. It includes popular options like IMDb TV, Pluto TV, and more, providing a great mix of free content and live TV.

**Cons:**

1. **App Installation:** While there are thousands of apps available, some less popular or niche streaming services might not be available. However, this is a minor inconvenience given the vast selection of mainstream apps.

2. **Storage Limitation:** The internal storage is limited, which can be an issue if you plan to download a lot of apps. Managing storage by regularly removing unused apps can help mitigate this.

**Overall:**
The Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K is an excellent streaming device that delivers high-quality performance and a vast content library. The combination of 4K streaming, Wi-Fi 6 support, and the convenience of Alexa makes it a standout choice for any home entertainment setup. Despite minor limitations, it offers incredible value and enhances the viewing experience significantly. Highly recommended!",5,B0CJM1GNFQ,2024-06-06,Positive

First of all, the setup process was a breeze. I simply plugged it in, downloaded the app, and I was up and running in minutes. The user interface is intuitive and easy to navigate, making it perfect for my non-tech-savvy family members to use as well.

The picture quality is STUNNING. Watching my favorite shows and movies in 4K is like experiencing them for the first time all over again. The colors are vibrant, the details are crisp, and the sound is crystal clear. I've watched some of my favorite movies and TV shows in 4K, and I'm blown away by how immersive the experience is.

The Alexa integration is also seamless. I love being able to control my TV with just my voice, and the Echo dot I have in my living room integrates perfectly with the Fire TV Stick. It's so convenient to be able to search for shows or play music without having to reach for the remote.

One of the things that really impressed me was the selection of apps available. Of course, all the major streaming services are there (Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, etc.), but there are also some great indie channels and niche services that I wouldn't have expected to find on a streaming device.

The only minor complaint I have is that the remote control could be a bit more robust. Sometimes it takes a few seconds for the commands to register, and it would be nice if there were more buttons for quick access to different features (like switching between apps or adjusting volume). But overall, these are minor quibbles compared to the many benefits of this device.

I did not know about the fire stick or any tv sticks for that matter.
I was told by a friend any stick will work with any tv that has a HDMI connection point.
Not true!
After talking with a tech at a Best Buy store, he got me started right!
My older tv I use on the patio is a 1080p only tv.
My tv could not process the signal from the 4K stick.
Once I got that figured out!
I got the 1080 stick going on my older tv.
Some other things I learned while trying to set up the 1080 fire stick to my older tv:
1. I had to move the tv close to my WiFi router to get it to connect.
2. The power adapter for the stick needs to be connected to its own plug in for power. Not an extension cord. (So, I had to reposition my tv on the patio to make the power cord for the adapter to reach the plug in.)
3. I had to plug in and unplug the fire stick about 3 times to get it to start the setup process. ( but that could have been my tv)
4. Once the setup process started it works good!
So now, my 2007 Visio 1080p tv works great with the Amazon 1080p Fire Stick! I can’t believe this tv is still working after 17 years! I am glad this fire stick worked!
I know, some of you are probably thinking: just buy a new tv! But this old Visio still works great and has a great picture with this Fire Stick.
I will be returning the 4K power stick; but again, only due to it was the wrong one for my tv.
It was my fault not Amazon’s fault.
Like anything, study it more than I did, to enable you to purchase the correct fire stick for your tv!",5,B0CJM1GNFQ,2024-07-28,Positive

The Apple Pencil Pro has proven to be an invaluable accessory for my iPad Pro 13-Inch (M4), offering advanced features and exceptional performance. I even got my wife hooked on it and needed to buy her one when I showed her all the features! Haha

First and foremost, the pixel-perfect precision of the Apple Pencil Pro is remarkable. It allows me to draw diagrams and take notes with incredible accuracy, which is crucial for my professional tasks. The tilt and pressure sensitivity further enhance its functionality, making it responsive to the nuances of my writing and drawing styles. I much prefer the pressure gestures over the tapping feature found in previous generations, as it feels more intuitive and natural.

One of the standout features of the Apple Pencil Pro is its industry-leading low latency. This ensures that my inputs are registered instantly, providing a smooth and natural writing experience. Whether I’m jotting down quick notes or drawing detailed diagrams, the performance is consistently reliable.

The Apple Pencil Pro attaches, charges, and pairs magnetically to the side of my iPad Pro, making it incredibly convenient to use and store. This magnetic connection ensures that the Pencil is always charged and ready to go, eliminating the hassle of dealing with cables and separate chargers. The seamless connectivity is another highlight, as it pairs effortlessly with the iPad Pro, maintaining a stable and reliable connection throughout use.

The build quality of the Apple Pencil Pro is top-notch, as expected from Apple. It feels sturdy and well-made, giving me confidence in its durability. The sleek design and smooth finish also complement the aesthetics of my iPad Pro, adding a touch of elegance to my setup. Additionally, the Apple Pencil Pro is impressively scratch-resistant, maintaining its pristine condition even after extensive use on my iPad.

In terms of usability, the weight of the Apple Pencil Pro is well-balanced but on the heavier side, which can cause writing fatigue during sustained usage. This is particularly noticeable during long work sessions where comfort is key.

However, it’s worth noting that the Apple Pencil Pro comes at a premium price. While it offers exceptional features and performance, it may be considered expensive compared to other stylus options on the market. Additionally, it would be great if Apple offered the Pencil in a color that matches the iPad, rather than the bright white. Despite these points, the value it brings to my workflow makes it a worthwhile investment for me.

In summary, the Apple Pencil Pro is an outstanding tool that provides pixel-perfect precision, tilt and pressure sensitivity, and industry-leading low latency. It is perfect for note-taking, drawing diagrams, and other professional tasks. The magnetic attachment, charging, and pairing add to its convenience and ease of use. Highly recommended for professionals and anyone looking to enhance their iPad experience with a high-quality, reliable stylus!",5,B0D3J71RM7,2024-06-30,Positive

I know, it’s my fault for not researching first and checking compatibility but dang, Apple, I’m pretty sure you guys did that on purpose so that you can get more sales with the newly released Pencil Pro.

That's why I was thrilled to discover this 2-pack of MFi certified USB-C chargers and lightning cables – a game-changer in terms of value and convenience.

Right out of the box, I was impressed by the quality of these chargers. They look sleek and feel sturdy, comparable to the official Apple products. But the real kicker is the price point, which is an absolute steal considering you get two chargers and two cables in the package.

The 20W power delivery ensures fast and efficient charging for my iPhone and iPad, just like the branded Apple chargers. I no longer have to worry about slow charging times or battery anxiety when I'm on the go.

One of the standout features for me is the generous 6-foot length of the lightning cables. As someone with a two-story house, this extra length has been a lifesaver. I can conveniently charge my devices from different locations without being tethered to the outlet. No more awkward positioning or cable management struggles!

The MFi certification also provides peace of mind, ensuring compatibility and safety with my Apple devices. I haven't experienced any issues with charging or data transfer, and the cables seem durable enough to withstand daily usage.

Overall, this 2-pack of chargers and cables has exceeded my expectations in terms of quality, performance, and value. I'm thrilled to have multiple charging options throughout my home without breaking the bank. If you're an Apple user looking for a reliable and affordable charging solution, this product is an absolute must-buy. Highly recommended!",5,B0BW5X89MM,2024-05-08,Positive

Speaker lover here. I recently bought this a week ago and received them recently. Tested them out.

If you bought these because of bass and you love bass, the bass selections that are already on the app don’t work at all and only add just about 5 percent extra bass if you chose one.

You’d have to play with the EQ in order to get the bass to work. Since I love speakers a lot and find them fun to use and enjoy the bass part. I’ve messed with the EQ on my phone and got the bass where it’s strong and sounds good but also to where you can still hear it.

I also found out that clear to the right on EQ, if you wanted to hear more of the voice, then move the label 4K up higher. It will decrease the bass by a small percentage but still give you that advantage to listen to the bass and still hear the voice louder.

Lowering the 4K will add more bass and lower the voice.

I’ve provided screenshots of what my configurations are on the EQ and what my general settings are for these earbuds from JBL.

My final review is the color is cool, the case is well durable, the earbuds themself are comfortable in your ears, they work well and have a high volume sound. They last a good amount of hours as well which is a big + for me.

So this time I thought I would try a set of earbuds instead. I know JBL usually have good products, price was decent, so I thought I would try these.

First I will say the sound and volume are pretty good. If you are using these on your phone, the JBL app also makes a big difference with the equalizer and the other ""hear through"" type features if you don't want to block out all noise. Really wish they had a similar app for PC, as I use them on my laptop more than my phone. And is really when I need to hear people talking etc.

With that said, the fit isn't great, I tried all the different sizes of the rubber covers, but none seem to fit right in my left ear for some reason. I've had it fall out once already when just bending over to pick something up off the floor.

They are also difficult to get out of the case, the lid should open further or just have a way to grab a hold of them easier.

The battery life is ok, but doesn't seem to be anywhere near the 32 hours listed, including the recharge feature of the case. I've gotten about half that, before they kept telling me they were ""low battery"". And I had to charge them and the case both back up.

all in all, these may work good for some people. I am thinking about returning them and trying something else though.",4,B0BQPNMXQV,2024-07-15,Neutral

However, let the disappointment begin...

For starters, the shell that holds the buds is super slippery. I wish everyone would stop that, they are so hard to handle while trying to get the buds out.

Now let's talk about the buds. They too are super slippery. It makes just getting the buds out of the case frustrating as all get out unless you have tiny fingers, I s'pose. On top of that, the way they position the buds inside the case for charging is mirrored of how Apple does it, and it's the wrong way. When you take the buds out, they are backwards to how you would put them in your ear. Now I need to spin them around just to put them in my ear, and again, they are slippery! I have big hands, so what might be a simple task for many is not simple for me. I drop them as a result and it just takes more time to answer a call.

What's even more frustrating than that is that they do not automatically connect for inbound calls. I always have to answer, then connect them manually. For outgoing calls, it has not been an issue at all.

Lastly, the call quality is subpar. My Apple Air Pods had great call quality (yes, I know how much they cost), but we're decades deep into these products, hard to understand why these would not provide a better connection.

Over the past 5 years I've probably owned 10-15 sets, ranging from $12 sets to $300 sets and THEY ALL HAVE PROBLEMS. From dropped connections to failing batteries or just plain crappy sound. So, this review is just on sound quality alone as I haven't put them through the gym ringer yet. Right out of the box these are the best sounding buds I've owned. The app is outstanding as well. I use a professional equalizer, but found that the app's equalizer is good enough on its own, that you really don't need anything else (though I use both for added volume and treble tweaks). These are LOUD, which is necessary at my gym to drown out the repugnant music selection played full blast through the Temu speakers on the wall and 18"" ridiculous subwoofers. I turn the buds all the way up and cut my source to about 65% and its plenty loud. The bass is more than adequate (had to turn it way down). But most importantly, the treble is good. This is unusual for earbuds. The treble is always the weak point in earbuds for whatever reason. Here, it's crisp and clear (if you know what you're doing with the eq). That's the thing. Knowing how to dial that equalizer in is the difference between your B&W 805d's at home and the crappy soundbar at your buddy's apartment. At $30, this is a no brainer. Even if they explode in my ears whilst I'm takin' the 120's for a ride, the last song I heard will be permanently etched in my mind for eternity. Thanks JBL!",5,B0BQPNMXQV,2024-08-24,Positive

That's a huge plus for me! The overall sound is incredible considering the price. The sound is great even when switching from one genre to another. I'm a metal head, so having the ability to hear every instrument precise and clear is what I've been looking for. The vocals are crisp and clear. Even when the band has a high pitched vocalist and a deep, throaty vocalist.
My only disappointment is the JBL App. I was hoping that the app would give you better options, but it doesn't, it has 4 choices for the equalizer, jazz, vocals, bass and extra bass. And then you can try to make an equalizer that fits your listening wishes. If your like me and don't have the required understanding of sound at different levels, then you get 4 basic options! Plus the app has very little else to make it worth downloading.

And when you can get multiple sizes and lots of them, it’s even better. But if the price is really cheap, beware. Now I like to bundle my zip ties up and put them in their own little places on the shelf I keep my Fastening things on. So let’s break this down.

I open the 6 inch zip ties bundled them together and then used one of those zip ties too hold them together… Not a problem at all.

The next one was the 8 inch zip ties bundled them together used one of the zip ties to hold them together and not a problem at all.

Then to the 10 inch zip ties bundled them together use one of those 10 inch zip ties and as soon as it got snug… POP! So I try another one, and it broke. Luckily the next one I tried  tightened up fine and didn’t break. We will see how they hold up when put under regular use… I’m betting it’s 50/50

Now to the 12 inch and this is where it’s a problem. Pull them together bundle  grab a zip tied to pull them apart, and as soon as I started pulling on it, that zip sound went away and it was smooth and I thought did it break? Anyway, pulled it tight and before it even got snug, the zip tie broke. This happened at least five more times before I went and got one of the 6 inch ones to hold this together. Everyone of the 12 inch zip ties I tried to use broke the little tongue that locks it in and then the zip tie itself broke… 100% failure.

I probably should’ve read some reviews but I didn’t  so that part is on me. I will use these, but I’m not holding out a lot of hope and next time I won’t cheap out… I’ll go to one of the big box stores and get a decent brand.",5,B08TVLYB3Q,2023-12-13,Neutral

However, that means a lot of things need to be secured to my bike's frame and while some accessories such as the rack already had mounting points with hardware on the frame, most of it didn't.  I bought this pack of zip ties to aid in securing the accessories in discussion.

Some of you may have looked at the four-star rating I gave this product, then read my review title and got a little confused.

The reason for that is that quality is really spotty with the ties I've used so far from this pack.  Some have had excess flash from the manufacturing process, and some have even had thick burrs or blobs of plastic stuck to them that I had to remove prior to use.

All that said, every zip tie from this pack that's on my bike has stayed put and I didn't have any issues installing the zip ties (after I removed said flash and blobs).  So, despite the spotty quality, I can't give this a low score.

Seeing as most if not all folks that use zip ties are DIY oriented, the quality issues I've experienced won't be an issue for such folks.  However, for instances such as an assembly line in a local business, then having to post process these zip ties may use up too much time.

On the positive side, having zip ties of different sizes in one package was convenient and allowed me to tackle various tasks. The range of sizes came in handy for different projects, and that's definitely a plus.

However, I found the quality of the zip tie tabs to be a bit disappointing. They were quite fragile, and I often had to use several zip ties to get one to work as intended. The tabs didn't have the sturdiness I expected, which was a bit frustrating when trying to secure items in place.

Another issue I encountered was the durability of these zip ties when exposed to sunlight. After just a couple of days outdoors, the zip ties started to become very fragile. They became brittle and started breaking easily, which was not ideal for outdoor applications.

Our experiences are very similar, though just a bit different.

THE GOOD

This system does what it says it will do. Both my wife and I are heavy into Apple products (iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches) and have been looking for a way out of the mass entanglement of cords that charging our various devices causes. This device fills that niche admirably. It is compact: both she and I can charge our iPhone and Apple Watch overnight on our respective nightstands with very little clutter: the power cord is long enough and overall the systems are very unobtrusive. The wireless charging feature is fantastic: getting rid of cords is always a good thing.

Another plus is that, as Apple Watches and iPhones can serve as clocks/alarms/etc., having them on our nightstands helps fulfill that purpose. The charging backs are at a slight angle; angled enough to hold the items in place but no so much that you can't see them. For my wife this has an added advantage; she is an inveterate Bluetooth headset user and with the source of her sound feed within easy reach, she finds this much more convenient than anything she has used previously.

Can't speak to longevity--yet--but the devices seem sturdy enough to last as long as we need them, and as there are no moving parts I can't that changing.

THE NOT-SO-GOOD:

My wife and I both have the same style of iPhone, but our Apple Watches are a bit different. The face size on hers is 40 mm, while mine is 44 mm. What makes this significant is that while there is no difference in the units handling our iPhones, it does make a difference with the watches as ,ome weighs just a bit more than hers. Hers attaches securely to the magnet holding the watch to the unit, while my watch, unless it is positioned precisely and carefully, has a tendency to slide down. The magnet is not quite powerful enough to hold my watch securely. A quick remedy is to place an item under the unit so that it tips back a bit more and when this is done the watch does not slip. Not a deal-breaker by any means but it IS something that people should be aware of.

Another thing: it isn't equipped to handle iPads. I can't really call this a criticism...I of course knew this when I ordered the units...but it would be nice if the product was designed to service the iPads as well. Maybe a later model will have that feature.

BOTTOM LINE:

Entirely satisfactory, but not perfect. I certainly don't regret buying them.",4,B0C2BMNHW2,2024-03-14,Positive

I had been trying to use off brand ink fillers but HP must have done an update because it no longer works. Replacing the ink for that printer would have cost me $85 versus $60.00 for this printer which included ink. It looks like the printer itself isn't how HP makes money but rather by forcing you to buy their ink. So, it's cheaper to buy a new printer than it was to fill the ink with new cartridges branded HP. Anyway, it's a pretty nice printer. It is smaller than my 8028 and a nice neutral color. I have done several pages of printing and the print quality is very good. In terms of connecting it via bluetooth, I had various levels of success. With some of my computers connecting was quite simple and fast. With others it took several attempts. There seems to be no rhyme or reason as to why it was easy on some computers and hard on others. The only thing I would change about this printer is its capacity for holding paper. It doesn't hold very much at one time.  For me this is not a big problem because I don't do much printing anymore, it seems like so much can be done electronically nowadays. But, if you are doing large batches of printing this might not be the right printer for you. You might want something with a larger capacity of holding paper so that you don't have to constantly fill it. Overall, I think this is a great printer for my needs and we'll see how much ink costs when it comes to that time. HP also tries to get you to subscribe on a monthly basis to ink replacement and they promise better pricing for your cartridges but they don't give you any pricing so I am going to wait until I actually need ink and then check pricing for the cartridges. Maybe by then I won't need to buy a new printer I can just buy new cartridges. We will see.",4,B0CT2R7199,2024-07-16,Neutral

Since the size is just a hair smaller than the glass on the iPad, you won't have to worry about something catching the edge of the shield and getting under it. If you hold diagonal corners with the thumb and forefinger pressed against the side edge of the shield, you will be able to position the other two diagonal corners to get a perfect lineup before you drop it down on the glass and let the adhesive start to work. The product itself is the best you can get in my opinion however the packaging left a little bit he desired. Worst packaging ever! There's no way to get to the product without destroying the packaging and now you have a second shield install kit with no package to contain it. Fortunately, I had also purchased an iPad keyboard and case set-up which came in a box that will perfectly house the second shield install kit. Do not be alarmed if the kit does not include the little cardboard squeegee tool because you won't need it. If your screen is clean you won't even need to use the microfiber to push down the shield. It's actually a really cool process to watch the screen protector stick itself to the glass like spilled water spreading in slow motion over a glass table top....",4,B0BJPXXM7D,2024-07-21,Positive

I will say the only thing that I have a problem with the fit of the AirPods.  Unlike the gen 1 and 2 that just hangs well on my ears they’d seem a little loose.  When I smile I can feel them dislodging.  The smaller size makes it hard to handle if you have bigger hands.

Especially since with my current AirPods starting to crap out. However, I’m going to be giving this review from the perspective of going from the 2nd gen AirPod pros to the 3rd gen. And it seems like bit of a downgrade.

Now, the 2nd gen pros have it all. The extra silicon tips, the noise cancellation & transparency, & the ability to wirelessly charge (the case). And I had them for a good long while (the longest I’ve had any AirPod) & the right bud is just starting to crackle when I play any audio through it and the battery is starting to go bad.

Overall, I was honestly a little disappointed with the 3rd gen. Granted, it’s not a pro version so it’s not going to come with the noise cancellation. But the lack of silicon tips for the buds was a little surprising. I have trouble with any earbud staying in my left ear especially, & I’ve used the 3rd gen during a few workouts so far & they’re staying pretty well. But, they still feel just a little off & I ended up buying silicon tips to put over the buds instead - those helped with a bit of noise cancellation and security in my ears. But to go from the 2nd gen pros to the 3rd gen feels like I’m losing a lot when it comes to function & capabilities.

Now, if you’re buying a pair of AirPods for the first time & just need the basics - then the 3rd gen is great. The bass sounds really good, overall sound quality is there & the buds without the silicon tips really aren’t that bad. If you’re used to that though, it’s going to take a bit to adjust with the 3rd gen. But, like I did, there are silicon tips you can get to put over the buds to help.",4,B0D1WXVQTN,2024-07-25,Neutral

Haven't had any luck with the danglers, keeping them in is too hard.

These have great bass and real noise cancellation. A bit better than earplugs. I work in a very noisy environment from time to time. I have used them for a day and I love their ability to dampen the noise. It's better than ear protection (I still feel the generators and machines rattling my bones, but that can't be helped). I walked down a busy street for a minute and the cars are not easy to hear with music playing. This is my first time uaing noise cancelling headphones besides some really really expensive ones my brother bought 10 or 15 years ago, by the way. I couldn't hear people talking at all with those when he let me try them on. With these, it is faint enough without music playing and if I do have them playing something, I wouldn't know it. So I am impressed.

The problem is these ones lag for me. There's that lip synch problem when I am watching a video with people talking, as if the audio is buffering for longer than the video on a streaming site. This is the price you pay for things like that. I have tried various things to see if it would change it, like wqiting until the voice tells me we're connected to my phone/tablet before starting a video or pulling it up.

Overall, I am impressed. They do just what I needed them to do. The lag is sad though. 3.8 out of 5. Worth it.",4,B0CT8K8LB7,2024-09-07,Positive

Pros: It expands as indicated to the full height. The gripper works even with my iPhone case, but I do have to remove my Popsocket first. The tripod is sturdy on a solid, flat floor, but I haven't tested it outside or on carpet/rugs. The remote works as expected to allow me to step away for videos. The tripod collapses down into a roughly 1-foot long piece when not in use, and you can use it without the tripod legs as a selfie-stick if you want, though it would be rather heavy for that use.

Cons: It's a bit tight when you first open it, so you need to extend and contract it a few times to get it working more fluidly. The weight is a bit much for carrying around, so if you're traveling you'll want to factor that into your packing. The tripod base works well on flat surfaces, but I worry that anything with uneven surfaces, texture and terrain, etc, would make it more prone to falling over. The sturdiness is all in the base, too, which means the extension is much lighter, so you have to make sure you hold it steady once you insert your phone or it might fall over. I would have liked to be able to angle my phone more, like at a 90-degree angle, for example, so I could hover it over a desk or counter for different projects, but I imagine I'll just need a separate product to do that. And as others have noted, the remote is very small, so you'll want to keep an eye on it when you remove it.

Overall, this does what I wanted it to do, and I'm pretty pleased with it so far. I'll likely begin using it for other things like family photos and videos, too, which might be helpful for actually being IN the picture instead of being the one taking it!",4,B0CJTL7Q3J,2024-07-26,Positive

I settled down, and get ready to apply the screen protector. So I have never used one of these so of course I am reading the instruction manual that comes along with it. Right away it says to use the wet wipes to clean the screen of your phone. I'm going through the package and there are absolutely no wet wipes. Obviously someone must have used them and return the package. But that's not all, it has these little white cloths that you use to wipe the screen of your phone with after wet wiping it. And one of them was kind of dirty and stained possibly by somebody's hands? I swear there's a fingerprint on it. So as I'm following the instructions it's telling me to cool down the protection mask that I guess is supposed to protect the glass screen protector sticky side. Note that there are two in the pack. So I have one in hand and one sitting on the table for later use. So I pick up one and I'm trying to figure out where I'm supposed to pull the mask protector from. I stared at it because with the instruction manual is telling me to pull I don't see. It's supposed to be a little tab at the top of the protection mask. I don't see the little tab that you're supposed to pull. So I put that one down and I pick up the other one, and what do you know, there's a tab on the other one. But not on the one I originally tried to use. So, I peel it with my nails and the protection mask comes off. All I see is this blue film. I read the instruction manual again and it says that the blue film is supposed to be there but where is the actual glass screen protector? The actual glass screen protector with missing. I swear I stayed about 30 to 45 minutes trying to figure out how this thing was supposed to work. But when I checked the second one that came with it there was a glass protector on that one. And that's when I realized this one must have been used and returned and then was sent to me when I ordered mine. First of all one of them is missing the glass screen protector. Second of all the wet wipes were gone. And third of all, when I opened the package you have these big screen dust removers that go over the screen of your phone completely to remove any dust. But I had noticed that those were rolled up and crinkled up at the bottom of the box. Surely they didn't come that way. Which led me to believe that I was sent a used one that was already returned and already used. Whoever returned this one literally used one of the screen glass protectors, used both wet wipes, and one of the white cloths. Very bad business I am returning mine. I really need a screen glass protector I am asking for a second replacement. Hopefully this one comes complete. The idea of this product is what I like. It's supposed to be an easy process to where you get the screen protector on the phone without messing it up. It can be very tedious work. And that is why I ordered it. The product I'm sure is amazing, but the business was really bad. Advice to the business: please check every returned product. There may be missing pieces or parts to the returned products. In this case I was missing one whole glass screen protector and the other one was missing the tab to pull down from. Wet cloth did not exist in this package. One bright white cloth with stained and dirty. And the dust removals one little one with missing and they were crinkled up and stuffed at the bottom of the box. I will try one more time because the price is not going to break me. But yes I am very disappointed for I was waiting excitedly to try this new product",1,B0CPJ1QBMR,2024-08-23,Negative

That's when I happened across this Echo Pop for less than half price -- yay Prime Day!  I had seen it before, but I kind of dismissed it, since I have no need for any speakers.  I simply didn't realize that a smart speaker isn't just for playing music and podcasts.  Fortunately, I took a closer look this time and realized this Echo Pop was exactly what I needed!

It was super-easy to set up, thanks in large part to being able to connect it to my Amazon account before I even completed check-out.  Now I can get the weather forecast, set reminders and alarms, and control my smart plugs by just talking to Alexa.  My smart plugs control lamps, fans, and things I want to be sure I always turn off or better yet, unplug, and I can now do all of that by talking to this Echo Pop.  I set up a second Echo Pop up in my bedroom, and I love how it works.  It tells me to get up, turns on my lamp, so I can't turn over and fall back asleep, and pretty much replaces my old style alarm clock.  I feel kinda dumb for not giving the Echo Pop a closer look when it first came out, but then again I'm glad I got it on super sale!

Update: while I'm just loved controlling my smart plugs and devices through with voice with the Echo Pop or through the Alexa app on my phone, I decided I needed an Echo Show. Big mistake. Although I got a $30 deal through Amazon Warehouse, the Echo Show was a big disappointment, slow to respond and much more tedious to set up thanks to a million options. Plus, it was absolutely loaded with annoying ads. Within 2 hours, I missed the perfect performance and simplicity of my awesome little Echo Pop, so the Echo Show went back in the box for a refund, and I'm back to enjoying life with my Echo Pop.",5,B09WNK39JN,2024-07-19,Positive

I have used fire sticks for over a decade & needed to update mine for more storage capacity.  The 4k is perfect.

Streamed shows or movies took forever to load, they would buffer, stop and start, or they just wouldn't start at all. Apps would open and then close again. It just wasn't a good experience. Checking the WiFi revealed a strong and fast signal and YouTube worked well on the TV. But streaming services weren't great. After checking everything on my side I thought the issue might be the small amount of storage granted by the Fire Light. Since I knew we were almost out of space, and still adding apps every time a movie is offered on a service you don't have, I thought that could be the cause of the buffering.
When I noticed the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K Max was on sale I pounced. It was receiving good reviews that said the performance was better. (Perhaps I should have watched some reviews on the Lite, but oh well.) Anyway, when I received it, I compared the amount of storage it provided to our old one and noticed it didn't provide more. I noticed that this version provides a more powerful processor, but I didn't see how it would help. I thought that it wasn't going to work, but I was surprised. The thumbnails and the UI are much snappier. We are having much fewer problems than we used to have. We still have the occasional app starting and then closing again as well as movies or shows not starting, but it happens far less frequently. The main issue we were having with Paramount + is corrected and we are not having issues with it anymore. So, I guess you can say that we are pleased.
The new volume and power buttons on the remote are nice additions, but the volume acts like it is repeatedly sending signals to communicate. I say that because the TV volume rises or lowers in a herky jerky manner. Considering I use HDMI there is no excuse for having to use multiple remotes for something as simple as volume or power.

I wanted a responsive device, and to try to ensure this, I figured I might as well go for the top model of the FireTV Stick, so I ordered the 4K Max. This device does not at all disappoint in that regard! It is very snappy while navigating through the UI and the various streaming apps I utilize, so I'm very pleased with that.

It comes with a short HDMI extender, which is a great touch because it makes using a ""stick"" form device such as this not interfere with being in the way of your other HDMI ports.

Make sure you use the power adapter it came with (or a USB adapter capable of outputting 2 Amps) because you will run in to problems quickly if it doesn't detect enough amperage. I rather wish it came with a longer cable, as it is not uncommon these days for a TV to be wall mounted, but that's just my own opinion.

Setup is very easily done and has nice guidance every step of the way. Even getting the remote to work with my TV was super easy and included in the first time setup guidance. The remote ended up only being able to control my TV's power and volume, which is not a big deal, and I'm sure most individuals who buy this intend to use it as the main source of media to play on their TV.

Streaming from various services is an absolute blast and I've had no issues there.

I rather wish there were more big name options for aftermarket remotes, it seems like there are for every other major streaming device, but on the other hand I've never personally heard of anyone's FireTV remote having issues.

If you have a non-smart TV or an aging smart TV that is getting laggy, the FireTV Stick will serve you well for years to come, go for it!

The FireTV Stick 4K Max also has an option for a service that allows you to play games from your PC on your TV, I am intrigued to try the trial of that at some point just to see how it is.

***For Plex users:**** This is in no way, as far as I can tell, any fault of the device itself. Certain movies will get stuck and after a while make an error pop up, and certain shows will result in the audio playing but the screen being stuck black when the auto play starts the next episode. I have tried everything, and I mean everything. Everything else has never given me this issue. I have gone so far as factory resetting the FireTV Stick, rebuilding my media libraries, cold starting every device on my network, and gone through every single setting in the Plex app. This has resulted in my second issue with the autoplay being seemingly resolved, but again I do not think it is the device itself, or anything on my network, because I have installed what is essentially a media player that can connect to network shares and everything plays with no issue that way. So, yes, it seems to be an issue with the Plex app itself. Unfortunately, it seems forums are full of Plex users experiencing such things on FireTV devices. Again I cannot fault the device or Amazon for this in any way. Unfortunately though it leaves me trying to decide if I should just continue using the player application on my FireTV Stick, which is connected to the only TV I use, and that is mostly what I use when I'm watching anything. If I do that, I have very little reason to run Plex, but I like its layout and I've put a lot of time and effort over the years in to getting it just the way I like it. I can hope that an upcoming update fixes things, I could buy a Plex Pass and see if this improves things, I could switch to Emby and pay their monthly charge, or I could purchase a different streaming device.....it's a tough spot....",5,B0BP9SNVH9,2024-05-24,Positive

First and foremost, let's talk about longevity. These batteries truly live up to their promise of ultra-long-lasting power. Whether it's powering a toy for hours of playtime or keeping a flashlight shining bright during emergencies, these batteries consistently deliver top-notch performance, time and time again.

But what sets Powermax batteries apart is their impressive shelf life. With a guaranteed 10-year shelf life, I can stock up with confidence, knowing that these batteries will be ready to go whenever I need them. Plus, the reclosable packaging makes storage a breeze, ensuring that the batteries stay fresh and protected until they're ready to be used.

Another thing I appreciate is the versatility of these batteries. They're compatible with a wide range of devices, from everyday household items to high-drain electronics, making them incredibly versatile and practical. Plus, the AA size is one of the most commonly used, so I know I'll always have the right battery on hand for whatever task comes my way.

And let's not forget about the value. With 24 batteries in each pack, it's an excellent value for the price, especially considering the quality and longevity they provide. It's a small investment that pays off big time in terms of convenience and peace of mind.",5,B0BFFNZLYY,2024-06-12,Positive

The hinge stickers could really be a lot stickier, but I got my protector in the perfect spot on the second try...after lifting it up to get the one speck of dust I missed near the middle of the screen.
The protector itself laid down nicely and adhered while pushing out nearly all of the air bubbles with little to no effort.  For ease of removing the remaining bubbles, I'd rate it in the better half of all the screen protectors I've ever applied (to phones, tablets, a Switch, etc), and staying put has been a problem in the 5 days since I did it.
Touch screen experience is a little changed, but I haven't noticed any significant lag or loss of sensitivity.
For anyone wondering, this protector works beautifully with the Zugu Case for the iPad 10th gen.  With proper placement, there's a gap of less than 1mm between the screen protector and the case--and the way around--and my fingers can't appreciated any difference in thickness between this screen protector and the lip of the Zugu that keeps the iPad in the case.

This one ended up with an excellent fit and bubble-free adhesion.  There were no step-by-step instructions and no positioning guide supplied.  I did a ""dry fit""  first and made sure the protector covered the screen for my iPad 10,  checking to make sure I knew that the cutout in the protector matched up with the camera position, the camera is not to be covered so be sure you don't install the protector upside down.  I did all the install in a well lit, still area in the house to avoid dust as best possible. I had a decent work surface where I could comfortably position the iPad and the screen protector side-by-side.  For the prep,  I wiped the ipad glass surface first with the supplied cloth to get rid of the most of the dust, then cleaned the full iPad glass surface with the wet-wipe using several passes.  I then I did a visual check of the surface to be sure I couldn't see any dust flecks - I didn't, so I didn't use the supplied dust pickup.  I then carefully removed the adhesive backing from the Screen protector - being very careful not to touch the adhesive side.  I tipped the screen to be sure it didn't touch the iPad screen surface, positioning the lower edge first.  I aligned the screen to be sure it was in correct position all along the lower edge of the iPad screen.  Then I gently let the protective screen come into contact with the ipad screen.  With the screens properly aligned, I then touched the lower right corner of the protective screen and let it adhere to the iPad screen.  It's a gradual process, taking 30 seconds or so.  You can watch the contact happen.  And from past experience, it's a bad idea to try to force this.  Let the protective screen attach on its own.  I didn't have any problems, but if there were dust particles that prevented adhesion, I'd recommend starting over after removing the known particles.",5,B0BDKJFRX4,2024-05-27,Neutral

It did it's job. I dropped it multiple times and after, I don't know maybe three times I wasn't sure if the screen was broke, or just the screen protector. I could still use it. It wasn't all splintered like some of these you see on tik tok. It was just three big lines across the screen. I pulled the screen protector off and it turns out my screen was broke. When I looked it up they wanted $150 to replace the screen on my old phone. I'm a old guy and I know these days everything has to be the new version or the software might not work with it. Why would I spend $150 dollars to replace the screen on a  iphone 7? So I got a new phone I don't like it. Where's my home button? It's very hard to get the screen protector aligned right. I think that may be why they give you three. If you get it wrong like I did, I lined up the top and when I looked at the bottom it was just crazily off. The top was right but the bottom was all janked up. It was all crooked. So I had to pull it off. Which is why I am posting this. You can pull it off and put it back on again. I did it. Don't just think you wasted your money. Pick it off with a box knife or something like that and it will go right back on the correct way.",4,B0B769QC6M,2024-09-05,Negative

I travel about 25% of the time for work, and this is extremely helpful for charging devices in airports. Instead of sitting on the floor (because it’s the only open outlet) to charge my phone before a flight, I can just plug right into my power bank. I also found myself frequently using this at home. I live in an old house with outlets in weird places so there’s no convenient outlet right next to my bed. Now, I just use the power bank! This would also be a useful tool to take camping or for road trips (so you’re not fighting with your spouse or children over who gets to plug their device in now).

In terms of battery life, I did track how many charges I could get out of a fully, 100% charged power bank. Each time, my phone was at a different percentage and I didn’t always charge it back up to 100%, so I added each percentage that it charged. On a fully charged bank, I was able to charge my IPhone 13 312% and my Garmin forerunner 935 35%. For each charge, there was only one device plugged in (though you could plug in multiple devices, if desired). Charging times varied, but on average I found that it took about 50 minutes to charge my phone by ~50%. Then, to charge the power bank itself, I drained the bank down to 0% and charged it back up to full charge. This process took about 6 hours.
It is important to note that these tests were conducted on a new power bank. I imagine you would have some degradation in battery life over time.

Finally, I will add a few final notes on random things I observed about the bank. I highly enjoyed that the it had the cords already attached. It has four cord options directly attached to the bank. These secure into the bank when you are not using them. I keep my nails short, and I did notice that it is slightly difficult to detach the ends of the cords from the bank to charge a device. If you prefer to use your own cord, there are three ports available to accept external cords. For dimensions, the bank is 6”x 3”x 1” and it weighs 11.7oz. So, it is quite portable even if you’re a “small purse person” like me.

Overall, I think this is an extremely useful tool for traveling and everyday use. I would definitely recommend this product.",5,B0CNCJ5HMJ,2024-03-20,Positive

Either they don't charge well themselves, or only give my phone half a charge even though the description swore it would charge it 5 times, etc.  This one, on the other hand, was an absolute dream!  First of all, it charges itself up really fast.  It also has it's own cords attached and believe it or not, you can actually use the attached USB cord to charge it! I was able to plug it into lamps with USB ports, a USB converter, and even the USB port on a bus to give it juice.  And really, even starting at like 50% it would still charge within an hour or so.  Then, as far as using it for my phone, it was great!  It would charge my phone very quickly with the attached cord and I could take my phone from like 15% to full within just 45 minutes to an hour.  If I was trying to use the phone at the same time, it would take longer, which makes sense.  And I could charge my entire phone up to 100% and still have plenty of charge left on it for someone else's phone, too.  I loaned it out a few times on my trip to others, too, since it has 4 cord options and will fit most devices.  Everyone that used it was really impressed with it, too, since there is no need to find or attach a cord.

Honestly, there is only one negative thing to say about the charger and that is its weight.  It is pretty heavy for a charger and you'll feel the weight in your bag or purse.  The weight makes it kind of clunky to carry around attached to your phone during charging and if you have to prop it somewhere while it charges, it can be tricky because it wants to fall over.

In summary, if weight isn't an issue, check and make sure one of the cords fits your device, and buy this charger!  You won't regret it.  If you're backpacking or something, then you'll have to search for a lighter one, but for me, I'm just thrilled I finally have a back up charger that works.",5,B0CNCJ5HMJ,2024-04-17,Positive

With that, I also bought a car mount from the same company for $30. That car mount is held on with a 3m sticker. I have 2 cars and wanted more mounts. So I went to Best Buy and bought a $20 car mount, which has a great magnet, but is only mountable through the AC vent. For $10 I bought this on Amazon and it has the best of both worlds. The ability to static mount, or the option to use the AC vent. Plus it comes with a metal ring to attach to your device. Great value.

I am using the $30 mount in my Lexus, the $20 AC mount for my Mazda, and I am using this one for the kitchen, mounted near the sink so I can use my phone while doing dishes or cooking. Although I did mount in my car/AC to test and it works great. It does not budge. I would definitely use it in my car over the $20 one, but this one is already reserved for the kitchen. I should have bought 2 or even 3 of these in hindsight. If I could do over I would buy 3 of these and save $30.

The only issue I have is the magnet is too strong. It works fine with the included magnet, but it's so strong on my Luxe 4 that it peeled the sticker/magnet off my phone. The magnets attract so well, it's like glue! I decided to use a touch of super glue to the Luxe 4/phone case to solve the issue. So far it's good. This probably won't be an issue if you use the included magnet. I used this on my wife's phone and the magnet works great and not overly magnetic like mine.

I like the product due to it's cost, flexibility, and strength of the magnet and inclusion of accessories. I have shopped around and this is a great value in comparison. Great for the car. 2 mounting options. Really can't beat it for the price.",5,B0C1Y8Z6VT,2024-04-30,Positive

it comes with two of them, so i tried the other one and moved it a bit over. this one is what ruined my dashboard. in the picture it looks like a small area that got rubbed off or sanded down, and that’s from the 3mm sticker. sooo i’m kind of upset about that. i also wish the balljoint with the sticker had more flexibility.

second, do heed the warning for the vent clip. if you tighten it too much it WILL break your vent. an entire bar of my vent fell off. two of them: one vertical and one horizontal. i will admit this one was probably on me, but i didn’t expect it to do THAT much damage. that being said, it does stay in place very well.

the magnet itself was perfectttt. if you don’t have a magsafe case, putting the magnet on your phone looks kind of weird and clunky. but other than that? i couldn’t ask for a better magnet.

soooo yeah. i say just heed the warning, and keep an eye on the sticker. you might need to get something else to hold it in place while it dries maybe? idunno. not bad enough for me to fully return it because the damage has already been done, but i may request a partial refund.

so do with this what you will!",3,B0C1Y8Z6VT,2024-07-17,Negative

I bought two of these, one to use in the car and the other at work to swap between vehicles. The vent one works good, but it also comes with two 3M mounts. I don't really need 4. I don't even know what I will do with one. I only got it for the vent attachment. I decided to mess around and use one of the 3M mounts to test to see if my tablet case could actually hold a adhesive kickstand or not since the rear is rubbery and super slick. I thought no way it would stick well to that. After sticking it on, I nearly broke the case trying to remove it seconds later. If it can stick to that, I have no doubt it would stick to any surface in one of the vehicles I would use it on. The magnet itself is pretty strong and have no fear of it coming off. So both options for mounting work really well. One of the two I bought did have a vent hook for the vent, so I had to have it replaced.

This ingenious solution has become a game-changer for anyone looking to hide multiple cords seamlessly while keeping furniture flush against the wall.

The ultra-thin design of the flat extension cord is a standout feature. It's practically invisible against the floor, making it a discreet and efficient way to power various devices without creating a cluttered appearance. No more tripping hazards or unsightly tangles – this cord keeps everything neat and organized.

One of the major benefits is the ability to push furniture flat against the wall, thanks to the slim profile of the cord. This has allowed me to optimize the layout of my room without sacrificing functionality. The plug easily tucks behind furniture, providing a clean and streamlined look that enhances the overall aesthetic of the space.

The cord's durability is also worth mentioning. Despite its slender construction, it's robust enough to handle the demands of everyday use. The high-quality materials ensure reliable performance and longevity, making it a worthy investment for anyone tired of dealing with bulky, traditional extension cords.

Installation is a breeze – just plug it in and forget about it. The cord's flexibility makes it easy to navigate around corners and under rugs, offering versatility in how you set up your electronic devices.

In conclusion, the flat extension cord is a must-have for those seeking a sleek and efficient solution to cord management. It not only eliminates the eyesore of tangled wires but also provides the flexibility to arrange furniture in a way that suits your space. Say goodbye to cable chaos and hello to a clean, organized living area! Highly recommended.",5,B0BWY8FBFP,2024-03-05,Positive
