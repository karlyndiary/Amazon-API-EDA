by Max Lucado
Hardcover Edition Purchased on Amazon - $24.13 (S/H included).

In the blink-of-an-eye
since time began
During daylight, night,
peacetime, or war -
The sight and sound
of rushing ocean waves
Have always caressed
the shorelines
- near and far.

In the blink-of-an-eye
when our 'eternal' spirit
Decides to be 'born-again'
in another lifetime -
We're greeted daily
by the rising sun's bright ray's
As a new chapter
of 'opportunity' awaits us
- at God‚Äôs unlocked door.

In the blink-of-an-eye
our storybook journey ends -
When we come around full-circle
and return to God
As a completed spirit
after experiencing life‚Äôs
'Evolving' lessons
‚Äì while on His earth.

I believe,
trust, love, respect, and
have faith in
One God -
our Creator.

With God,
all great things
- are possible.

Without God -
There would be
- No Creation.

In the beginning of time, all ‚Äòspirits‚Äô were created at once, in God‚Äôs image, in God's 'Nirvana.'

We are all old ‚Äòspirits.‚Äô There are no new ‚Äòspirit's.'

While on His earth -
we are all connected
To God's -
Web-of-Life.

God's plan for us is clear.

In God's, ‚ÄòWeb-of-Life,‚Äô God's greatest gift of, 'Free-Will,' allows His sons, and daughters, in His 'Spirit Kingdom,' the 'opportunity' to live many lifetimes on His earth, as male and female, and to experience 'life' in each of the 'Races,' and, to learn to make 'Peace on Earth' with one another a reality, while we all 'spiritually evolve' in the 'physical' and come around 'full-circle.'

God is a Supreme Artist
and an All-Knowing Creator.

God does not 'Command' us to do anything.

God does not ‚ÄòInterfere‚Äô in our daily 'physical' lives.

God does not play 'favorites.'

We are all ‚Äòspecial‚Äô to God.

Each of us - is a storybook, a picture album, consisting of many lifetimes and experiences learned - up to our present lifetime on earth, which are stored in our ‚Äòspirit‚Äôs eternal memory.'

‚ÄòSouls are poured from one into another of different kinds of bodies of the world.‚Äô ‚Äì Attributed to the teaching of Jesus Christ in the Gnostic gospels: Pistis Sophia.

God allows His family of ‚Äòspirits‚Äô to chart their own present destiny (Free-Will) and all future quests (spiritual growth).

God‚Äôs door is always open for us to seek 'opportunities' at 'physical' life (born-again) to further 'evolve' our 'spirit' to reach a higher level of 'Spirituality.'

All 'spirits' have their own ‚Äòsignature‚Äô personality, which identifies their unique 'spirit' from another 'spirit.'

That ‚Äòsignature‚Äô belongs to them each and every time their 'spirit' decides to 'incarnate' to ‚Äòphysical‚Äô earth.

Some lifetimes are long. Some unfortunately, are short-lived due to an unforeseen accident or circumstance, or, by ‚Äòhuman‚Äô reckless behavior.

God, our Father, is all-merciful.

God‚Äôs unconditional love for His family gives us unlimited chances to succeed in ‚Äòphysical‚Äô life.

God ‚Äòis not‚Äô responsible for causing pain, suffering and chaos around an unstable globe.

We are wholly to blame.

We have forgotten the Golden Rule -
‚ÄòDo unto others as you would have them do unto you.'

Instead, we empower evil to flourish and we do nothing to terminate the terror we‚Äôve created from destroying humanity.

Hate is Ugly and a Sign of Weakness.

Hate is the 'Prejudice Labeling' of another human-being.

Out of control hate is a malignant cancer that spreads and fuels murderous behavior and world destruction.

The mind is a terrible thing to waste on spending a lifetime hating human-beings of all Races.

If hate prevails - humanity fails.

Love and compassion are still ‚Äì the strongest emotions.

We cannot learn all about life in a single lifetime.

It is impossible.

It takes many lifetimes, being male and female, for our 'spirits' to evolve, and come around ‚Äòfull-circle,‚Äô in order to become ‚Äòcompleted spirits,‚Äô and return to God, on our own 'Free-Will.'

In many cases, Memories, of our past-lives, are 'carried-over' into our next 'physical' lifetime, and are Remembered, after birth, at an early age, after a 'spirit' decides to 'return' soon after passing in their previous lifetime. The memories disappear, as we get older in our 'present' lifetime.

If a 'spirit' was a male, in 'several consecutive' lifetimes, and 'he' chooses to be a 'female' in his next 'physical' lifetime, sometimes his 'past-life male memories' interfere, and become confused (transgender) during the transition, and can't accept / adjust to the sudden change of being in a female's body, and he / 'she' is sometimes likely to feel more comfortable in a he - 'female' / female relationship.

If a 'spirit' was a female, in 'several consecutive' lifetimes, and 'she' chooses to be a 'male' in her next 'physical' lifetime, sometimes her 'past-life female memories' interfere, and become confused (transgender) during the transition, and can't accept / adjust to the sudden change of being in a male's body, and she / 'he' is sometimes likely to feel more comfortable in a she - 'male' / male relationship.

Most 'spirits,' rotate often being male, and female in their previous lifetimes, and are better able to adjust to the 'change' in their current 'physical' bodies, are able to live normal lives, and continue to fulfill their missions (spiritual growth) while ‚Äòevolving‚Äô to reach a higher level of 'Spirituality.'

When an expectant mother has an unfortunate miscarriage, or, the infant is stillborn, it simply means, the in-coming 'spirit,' utilized its 'Free-Will' right, and made a 'Pro-Choice' decision, and changed its mind not to 'enter' the soon to be newborn's body.

In other words, the incoming 'spirit' became 'aware' of an unexpected imminent 'danger' to the 'spirit's' present mission (spiritual growth), and decided at the last moment to, a b o r t, and continues its search in locating another expecting mother, so it can be 'born again' in the 'physical,' and live out its new lifetime to its fullest, and complete its overall 'mission' - to further 'evolve.'

This 'Spiritual' learning process of ‚Äòevolving,‚Äô to reach a higher level of 'Spirituality,' and returning to God, by living in the 'physical,' hasn't changed --- since time began.

God loves us and gave each one of His family, His 'Freedom' gift of, 'Free-Will,' for us to make our own decisions, and choices in life.

Preamble to the Declaration of Independence:
‚ÄúWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with ‚Äòcertain unalienable Rights,‚Äô that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.‚Äù

God's Law of, 'Free-Will,' to all humanity is violated, when human-beings take it upon themselves to force, 'Their-Will,' on other human-beings.

Under God's 'Free-Will' Law - I cannot tell you how to run your life, and you do not have the absolute right to tell me how to run my life.

No fallible human-being, church, government, nor court, has the absolute right to commandeer our all-merciful Father's precious 'Freedom' gift of 'Free-Will, and ‚ÄòPro-Choice‚Äô from us, while we are on our 'Spiritual' journey to 'evolve' in becoming completed 'spirits' on God‚Äôs earth.

To force one's 'Free-Will' on another, or on an entire Nation, violates God's ‚ÄòSupreme Law‚Äô to humanity.

Psalm 119:
163 I hate and loathe falsehood,
But, I love Your law.
165 Those who love Your law have great peace,
And nothing causes them to stumble.

We are all on borrowed time...

Our beloved America (Land of the Free) and humanity will perish -

A) If our country surrenders, without a fight to halt the Illegal Invasion of our Homeland, by the Indoctrinating Controlling Human-Beings in high power positions - as they Knowingly, Intentionally, and Recklessly force their 'Destructive and Misguided Socialist Ideology Will' against God's 'Free' Nation (United States of America and its Constitution).

United We Stand Tall, divided, we fail and fall.

B) When the senseless, continuous cycle of innocent human-beings, young and old, being shot, and murdered in the streets increases to a Barbaric Level (Domestic and War) - Where humanity can no longer Survive, grow 'Freely,' and 'Evolve Spiritually' while on God‚Äôs earth.

Our Children‚Äôs Future ‚Äì is in Our Hands.

C) When God's 'Natural Law and Order' of Life between His Kingdom (Spirit), and His earth (Physical) is disrupted and severed, by Unrestrained Artificial Intelligence, and the Cloning of human-beings.

The Forbidden Fruit - Genesis 2:16-17 (KJV).

When that dire day in history arrives, Good vs. evil, Love vs. hate, Peace vs. war, will start all over again - somewhere in time - forever and ever --- until we all get it right.

Psalm 34:
12 Whoever of you loves life
and desires to see many good days,
13 Keep your tongue from evil
and your lips from telling lies.
14 Turn from evil and do good;
seek peace and pursue it.

Truth
is learned-
One person
-at a time.

22,R1JK4G6GG37LVH,"You Need Hope, You Will Find It Here","Living right outside of Washington, DC can be a little rough at times. We hear the helicopters going over our house to the numerous bases around us, we know that we cannot talk to friends or people at church about politics because you could be talking to an aide for a congressman or someone from the White House. So, when I picked up this book, I was quite a bit hopeless. Where can our hope come from during an election year that has been this crazy? I found it in the first few pages of this book.
None of this matters from the viewpoint of Revelation. Much like Max, we are seeing things that point to the end times and, much like Max, I needed to find hope in looking up (Col 3:2) and not at what was happening around us. Right from the beginning, the anticipation of Christ coming was able to wipe away my worries. ""God tells us what to expect not to scare us, but to prepare us,"" was comforting because it feels like most of the world is out to scare us right now.
No one has explained Judgment Day in such a way where I actually look forward to it. ""We disdain judgment but value justice, yet the second is impossible with the first."" How long have we yearned for justice and now it is promised.

24,R1RX4Y7IL1679I,"Kids need to be social, not on social media","After finishing Jonathan Haidt‚Äôs The Anxious Generation, I couldn‚Äôt wait to recommend it to my family, friends, and others. I truly believe this book is a must-read for anyone with a smartphone, children, or, well, a pulse. Smartphones‚Äô impact has been so fast and pervasive in our culture that we are only beginning to understand how they are changing us.

Because of that, The Anxious Generation is one of the most important nonfiction books I have read this year, perhaps in several years. While many have expressed concern about the impact of mobile phones and social media on our youth, Haidt has made it his mission to uncover the symptoms, explain the effects, and convince us to change how we raise our kids regarding phones and social media.

The insights provided in The Anxious Generation make a compelling case for reevaluating the age at which we give our children phones, the extent of their Internet and social media access, and the value of free play. Haidt argues that smartphones, social media, and helicopter parenting have contributed to a decline in the mental well-being of young people. The book offers practical solutions crucial for fostering the emotional maturity and stability of our children and ourselves.

At the book‚Äôs center are four cultural norms Haidt argues we must implement to address the mental health crisis among our youth. These norms serve as a framework for his argument and practical solutions.

First, no smartphones before high school. Parents should delay children‚Äôs entry into round-the-clock internet access by giving them only basic phones (phones with limited apps and no internet browser) before ninth grade (roughly 14).

Second, no social media before 16. Let kids get through the most vulnerable period of brain development before connecting them to a constant stream of social comparison and algorithmically chosen influencers, which can significantly impact their self-esteem and mental health.

Next, phone-free schools. All elementary through high school, students should store their phones, smartwatches, and other personal devices to send or receive texts in phone lockers or locked pouches during the school day. This policy is crucial in creating a distraction-free environment that allows students to focus on their studies and social interactions.

And, last,  far more unsupervised play and childhood independence. That‚Äôs the way children naturally develop social skills, overcome anxiety, and become self-governing young adults.

Some money quotes?

‚ÄúMy central claim in this book is that these two trends‚Äîoverprotection in the real world and underprotection in the virtual world‚Äîare the major reasons why children born after 1995 became the anxious generation.‚Äù
‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt get depressed when they face threats collectively; they get depressed when they feel isolated, lonely, or useless.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe two big mistakes we‚Äôve made: overprotecting children in the real world (where they need to learn from vast amounts of direct experience) and underprotecting them online (where they are particularly vulnerable during puberty).‚Äù
‚ÄúWhile the reward-seeking parts of the brain mature earlier, the frontal cortex‚Äîessential for self-control, delay of gratification, and resistance to temptation‚Äîis not up to full capacity until the mid-20s, and preteens are at a particularly vulnerable point in development‚Äù
‚ÄúIn this new phone-based childhood, free play, attunement, and local models for social learning are replaced by screen time, asynchronous interaction, and influencers chosen by algorithms. Children are, in a sense, deprived of childhood.‚Äù
‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt let preteens buy tobacco or alcohol, or enter casinos. The costs of using social media, in particular, are high for adolescents, compared with adults, while the benefits are minimal. Let children grow up on Earth first, before sending them to Mars.‚Äù
‚ÄúStress wood is a perfect metaphor for children, who also need to experience frequent stressors in order to become strong adults.‚Äù
‚ÄúChildren can only learn how to not get hurt in situations where it is possible to get hurt, such as wrestling with a friend, having a pretend sword fight, or negotiating with another child to enjoy a seesaw when a failed negotiation can lead to pain in one‚Äôs posterior, as well as embarrassment. When parents, teachers, and coaches get involved, it becomes less free, less playful, and less beneficial. Adults usually can‚Äôt stop themselves from directing and protecting.‚Äù
‚ÄúBy designing a firehose of addictive content that entered through kids‚Äô eyes and ears, and by displacing physical play and in-person socializing, these companies have rewired childhood and changed human development on an almost unimaginable scale.‚Äù
‚ÄúGen Z became the first generation in history to go through puberty with a portal in their pockets that called them away from the people nearby and into an alternative universe that was exciting, addictive, unstable, and‚Äîas I will show‚Äîunsuitable for children and adolescents.‚Äù
‚ÄúOver the course of many decades, we found ways to protect children while mostly allowing adults to do what they want. Then quite suddenly, we created a virtual world where adults could indulge any momentary whim, but children were left nearly defenseless. As evidence mounts that phone-based childhood is making our children mentally unhealthy, socially isolated, and deeply unhappy, are we okay with that trade-off? Or will we eventually realize, as we did in the 20th century, that we sometimes need to protect children from harm even when it inconveniences adults?‚Äù
‚ÄúWe are embodied creatures; children should learn how to manage their bodies in the physical world before they start spending large amounts of time in the virtual world.‚Äù
‚ÄúOne way that companies get more users is by failing to enforce their own rules prohibiting users under 13. In August 2019, I had a video call with Mark Zuckerberg, who, to his credit, was reaching out to a wide variety of people, including critics. I told him that when my children started middle school, they each said that most of the kids in their class (who were 10 or 11 at the start of sixth grade) had Instagram accounts. I asked Zuckerberg what he planned to do about that. He said, ‚ÄúBut we don‚Äôt allow anyone under 13 to open an account.‚Äù I told him that before our call I had created a fake account for a fictional 13-year-old girl and I encountered no attempt to verify my age claim. He said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working on that.‚Äù While writing this chapter (in August 2023), I effortlessly created another fake account. There is still no age verification, even though age verification techniques have gotten much better in the last four years nor is there any disincentive for preteens to lie about their age.‚Äù
‚ÄúOur kids can do so much more than we let them. Our culture of fear has kept this truth from us. They are like racehorses stuck in the stable.‚Äù
‚ÄúMany of the best adventures are going to happen with other children in free play.
‚ÄúAnd when that play includes kids of mixed ages, the learning is deepened because children learn best by trying something that is just a little beyond their current abilities‚Äî in other words, something a slightly older kid is doing. Older kids can also benefit from interacting with younger kids, taking on the role of a teacher or older sibling. So, the best thing you can do for your young children is to give them plenty of playtime, with some age diversity, and a secure loving base from which they set off to play.

‚ÄúAs for your own interactions with your child, they don‚Äôt have to be ‚Äúoptimized.‚Äù You don‚Äôt have to make every second special or educational.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a relationship, not a class. But what you do often matters far more than what you say, so watch your own phone habits. Be a good role model who is not giving continuous partial attention to both the phone and the child.‚Äù",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1RX4Y7IL1679I,Daniel Burton,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/1faa94b4-3598-4014-9010-e3d62dcb56e1._CR0,0,400,400_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on July 4, 2024",True,72 people found this helpful,B0C9N2L56X,,,
25,R3UJBG7WFSRV75,The Siren Call of the Smartphone,"Childhood got rewired.  The great rewiring was the result of two events.  First, the market penetration of smartphones.  ‚ÄúGeneration Z became the first generation in history to go through puberty with a portal in their pocket that called them away from the people nearby,‚Äù people with whom they might otherwise have interacted directly, and into ‚Äúan alternative universe‚Ä¶‚Äù Absorption into this ‚Äúalternative universe‚Äù coincided with the second event.  Specifically, smartphone emerged as parents began ‚Äúoverprotecting [their] children in the real world.  The confluence of these events if well captured by a letter Haidt received from 14-year-old Rhode Island girl who described discovering porn sites while her mother in an adjacent room focused on the quality of food her daughter consumed.
 Haidt cites substantial survey research showing a rise in teenage depression and anxiety, especially among girls, as smartphones became familiar fixtures among teens.
 One difficulty I have in reading The Anxious Generation was Haidt‚Äôs expectation that societal stress would immediately affect young people.  The great recession, Sandy Hook, 9/11, the relentlessly dire predictions associated with climate change and, presumably, other sources of societal stress should have been reflected in rising depression among teens. ‚ÄúBut this did not happen‚Äù to teens who witnessed those events; ‚Äútheir rates of mental illness did not worsen during their teenage years.‚Äù  Haidt ignores the possibility that anxiety may not emerge at precisely the time that events are noticed, but may accumulate over time.  As a result, in Haidt‚Äôs account, the smart phone bears the brunt of the unfortunate re-wiring while other possible causal factors are brushed aside.
 Haidt recognizes that there is more than one way to raise a child, but he clearly favors parents who structure less, and permit more.  Borrowing a concept from Nicholas Taleb, Haidt maintains that children are ‚Äúanti-fragile‚Äù beings who need to get knocked over now and then in order to become strong.‚Äù  A phone-based childhood, far from protecting kids, actually fails to develop strong children through the social deprivation, sleep deprivation, attention fragmentation and addition it entails. Children should be allowed to interact with the world outside the fretful gaze of nervous parents. For example, parents could begin by ‚Äúletting your kids out of your sight without having a way to reach you.‚Äù
 It is difficult to imagine that the majority of parents in, say, an urban setting, would be comfortable doing this.  The difficulty with Haidt‚Äôs approach here is that, while he may be correct that kids are anti-fragile, their parents are almost certainly not.  Imagine (and Haidt would argue that imagining things is part of the problem) that a parent has to contact the police, inform them that one of their children is missing and acknowledge they intentionally have no idea where their child might be off to.
I, for one, never seriously entertained the prospect of children being kidnapped until, very shortly after becoming a parent, a kidnapping took place very near where I lived at the time, though thankfully it was resolved favorably in roughly a week's time.  Nevertheless, once that happens, it's impossible not to go into a protective mode.
 Haidt proffers other ideas for restricting smart phone use that parents could readily embrace.  Haidt may exaggerate the role of smart phones and parental over-protection, but his thesis remains compelling in many respects.  The Anxious Generation, as its lofty position on best seller lists indicates, has clearly touched a nerve.

27,R8OGMTDFVUR9J,Crucial!,"There is this creeping feeling that things are amiss, which keeps snagging our perceptions and catching on our minds. Some people shift the blame to this or that political party to explain the trouble or fault the stupidity and lameness of ‚Äúthose younger folk‚Äù. Most of the time much of the blame and assertions are prejudicial anecdotes with very little research or factual analysis. That‚Äôs where Jonathan Haidt comes in. Haidt is the Thomas Cooley Professor of Ethical Leadership at New York University‚Äôs Stern School of Business. He is also the author of several valuable works and papers, such as ‚ÄúThe Righteous Mind‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Coddling of the American Mind‚Äù and other compositions. In March of 2024 he published ‚ÄúThe Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Is Causing an Epidemic of Mental Illness‚Äù. This 400-page hardback, along with the supporting website at anxiousgeneration.com, give thoughtful, concerned readers a ton of factual research and analysis that diagnose what‚Äôs ailing us, but it also maps out practical ways ‚Äúto reclaim human life for human beings in all generations‚Äù (17).

Haidt carefully walks readers through numerous studies to show that there has been a multi-decade trend in American society (and the West) that has rewritten childhood, and the consequences are showing up with alarming frequency among those in the teens and twenty. He calls this trend the ‚ÄúGreat Rewiring.‚Äù As he notes, the ‚Äúmost intense period of this rewiring was 2010 to 2015, although the story I will tell begins with the rise of fearful and overprotective parenting in the 1980s and continues through the COVID pandemic to the present day‚Äù (4). In a nutshell, the author shows how two trends have brought our teens and twenties to be an anxious generation: (1) overprotective parenting that removed kids from play-based childhood and brought them into (2) phone-based childhood. This is a childhood shaped early by easy, unprotected access to social media and the internet. ‚ÄúMy central claim in this book is that these two trends ‚Äì overprotection in the real world and underprotection in the virtual world ‚Äì are the major reasons why children born after 1995 became the anxious generation‚Äù (9). That is the book in summary, and every chapter makes his case over and over again.

In regard to overprotective parenting in the real world I can personally testify. The social pressure to protect our kids pushed us to restrain their independence as the grew up, because we were told repeatedly that there were sexual predators under every bush and around every corner.  And then the increasing expectation was that no sensible parent would leave their eight-year-old child alone or allow their eleven-year-old to walk to the local grocery store, and more. ‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt blame parents for ‚Äúhelicoptering.‚Äù We should blame ‚Äì and change ‚Äì a culture that tells parents that they must helicopter.‚Äù This created, and still creates, an environment where ‚Äúindependence milestones‚Äù disappear ‚Äúunder a mountain of media-fueled fear‚Äù (254).

Then, concerning the underprotective parenting in the virtual world, Haidt states that when ‚Äúwe gave our children and adolescents smartphones in the early 2010s, we gave companies the ability to apply variable-ratio reinforcement schedules all day long, training them like rats during their most sensitive years of brain rewiring. Those companies developed addictive apps that sculpted some very deep pathways in our children‚Äôs brains‚Äù (136). The majority of the book‚Äôs chapters work through this underprotection in the virtual world, and how it is fomenting emotional and mental troubles for our young adults, as well as many older adults.

But the author is not like so many other writers and thinkers who only tell us what‚Äôs wrong. He weaves into his volume remedial aspects, and then takes four concluding chapters to speak to parents, teachers and administrators, governments, and tech companies. Not only are his suggestions helpful and practical, but they also seem to me to be common sense. As a Christian minister, his points and suggested solutions have stirred me think about how our congregation can be part of the cure for girls and boys, younger men and women.

For example, Haidt ‚Äì who is not a Christian ‚Äì recommends families and communities take a ‚Äúdigital Sabbath‚Äù (204). Similarly, he applauds the value of communal rituals, social practices where people move together and ‚Äúenter the realm of the sacred together, at the same time.‚Äù And that as this happens then as communities ‚Äúengage in these practices together, and especially when they move together in synchrony, they increase cohesion and trust, which means they also reduce anomie and loneliness‚Äù (202-203). There is so much more, but one of the crucial ideas is to recognize, for us and our teens and twenties, that often social media platforms do not foster forgiveness, patience, slowness to anger, readiness to forgive. Instead, ‚ÄúSocial media trains people to do the opposite: Judge quickly and publicly, lest ye be judged for not judging whoever it is we are all condemning today. Don‚Äôt forgive, or your team will attack you as a traitor‚Äù (211).

28,R1ARR06670F89D,Jonathan Haidt's The Anxious Generation Sparks Urgent Reflection and Action,"Jonathan Haidt's The Anxious Generation is, simply put, one of the most important and vital works of nonfiction I've read, and‚Äîquite possibly‚Äîthe most influential book on my wife and I's parenting style and approach to technology.

The Anxious Generation is bombshell after bombshell detonating all of our preconceived assumptions about social media, Gen Z, parenting, ""safetyism,"" mobile phones, childhood, education, and mental health. You've probably long suspected some of Haidt's observations and conclusions, but to see them put to words‚Äîand backed by heaps and heaps of research, neuroscience, philosophy, and spiritual musings‚Äîis to have your assumptions about what we consider ""normal"" rocked to its very core.

I'm so thankful I read this book prior to the birth of my daughter. This is a book I want to put into the hands of every parent, want-to-be parent, teacher, politician, tech CEO, or anyone who works/engages with children and/or cares about the collective mental health of our country. I firmly believe that if enough people‚Äîespecially parents of young children‚Äîread this book, it could change the trajectory of our nation's approach to technology and childhood.

In short, Haidt's argument boils down to one salient point: We've overprotected our children from the real world, and underprotected them from the virtual world.. He advocates for a return to the ""play-based childhood,"" and points the transition to the ""phone-based childhood"" as the primary driver of a significant increase in anxiety, depression, and self-harm among teenagers‚Äîespecially teenage girls. Additionally, because of culture's perpetual fear-based approach to child-rearing, we've left our kids woefully unprepared for the pressures of the ""real world""‚Äîand points to evidence of the startling number of Gen Zers and younger Millennials who appears trapped in a state of perpetual young adulthood.

The best aspect of The Anxious Generation is how easy it would've been for Haidt to just document a series of social ills and offer a diagnosis. But the back half of this book is full of extremely practical steps, application points, and ""rules"" for ensuring your children don't have their neurobiology hacked by tech companies who only want to monopolize their attention‚Äîmental health consequences be damned. And, even though the harms hone in on Gen Z and younger Millennials, I find myself often convicted of my own habitual phone use throughout the course of this book and I realize even I didn't escape unscathed.

Read this book. Buy a hard copy and highlight it. I want to give a copy to all of my friends, young parents, and teachers. And not just because I want to discuss this book‚Äîbut, because as Haidt points out over and over again, this is a cultural issue that requires mass collective action in order to change.

I'm not very tech savvy so didn't pick up on it very much, but kids were bringing them to class.  I never caught anyone using them there that I know of, but as I said, I'm not savvy on things about computers more than that I myself learned to play solitaire on it - and developed what must have been a temporary addiction.
The Smartphone?  Haidt gives tons of documented information using graphs, which he then uses in discussion.
Looking back, I can think of 2 students who must have developed addictions and went to the extremes :: one, a female student committed suicide, and another a male, became a hermit, and I suppose he must have locked himself in his room, but I never did hear what became of him - it's like he just disappeared from school.
To solve a problem, whether in math or social studies, et al.,  you must first define the problem.  And this, being a fairly early book on the subject does that fully, starting with the physical development of the human brain.
The co-subject discusses how recess has been taken away from elementary students and the ""freedom to play"" and be a kid is now denied to them.  I saw this at the Middle School I taught at.
Finally, I'll have to say this reminded me of a lot of the things I missed out on in my youth.
Growing up on a dairy farm meant I had to be there twice a day, and no extra curricular school activities were allowed.  So, I had few friends and when I did want to 'play' I had to invite them to my house.  But, for the most part, did not ever go to their homes.

32,R34IHY1FY0K1YJ,Serious Questions and Difficult Solutions,"Social scientist Jonathan Haidt‚Äôs The Anxious Generation articulates details of a new psychological/social malady swiftly metastasizing in our culture. Wickedly, it begins in childhood, with the consent and abetting of adults. Smartphones, and other digital devices, ‚Äúbring so many interesting experiences to children and adolescents that they cause a serious problem. They reduce interest in all non-screen-based forms of experience (author‚Äôs italics)‚Äù. This is the fundamental understanding at the core of the author‚Äôs thesis. Throughout The Anxious Generation, Haidt attempts to ask and answer in detail the following questions of the toxic cultural change we are living through: What has happened? How do we know it has happened? Why has it happened? What can we do about it?

Haidt writes: ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show what governments, tech companies, schools and parents can do to reverse the disastrous transition from play-based to phone-based childhood.‚Äù He gives us a banquet of food for thought, but the elephant in the room remains: are citizens hungry for what he serves?

The book asserts that childhood‚Äôs necessary learning experiences have been curtailed by a cultural confluence of toxic events: safetyism that has moved from exclusive emphasis on physical safety to include now fears regarding emotional safety (safe rooms in colleges). Documented diminished confidence in faith-based and civil institutions also contributes to more disassociated adult human interaction.

‚ÄúOn the internet, everyone is the same age, which is no particular age. This the main reason why a phone-based adolescence is badly mismatched with the needs of adolescents‚Ä¶It all got worse during the COVID years of ‚Äòsocial distancing‚Äô and online everything.‚Äù According to studies reported by Haidt, ‚Äú45% of teens report that they use the internet ‚Äòalmost constantly‚Äô‚Ä¶[This] has enormous implications for cognition.‚Äù

In 2017, Israeli psychologist, Professor Sam Vaknin, characterized the hording or paucity of hits on social media ‚Äúlike‚Äù buttons as a conditioning process, comparing it to the electrodes implanted in a rat‚Äôs brain to deliver a pleasure-jolt of dopamine. This conditions the rat to choose the pleasure bar instead of the food bar, and the rat will begin to starve itself. Vaknin, citing eating disorders and suicide statistics among teenagers, especially girls, stated that giving up addiction to social media is a two-step process that requires first, deprograming, and second, withdrawal. What has evolved is, en-masse, a serious mental condition, in kind with brainwashing.

Haidt offers potential solutions to the early, deleterious pre-teen exposure to smartphone dysphoria: 1. No smartphones before high school. 2.No social media before 16. 3. Phone-free schools. 4. Far more unsupervised play and childhood independence. The Anxious Generation says these goals probably might be effective. But will enough parents collectively agree to them? There is no current answer to that question.

Haidt writes: ‚ÄúThe Great Rewiring of Childhood pulled young people out of real-world communities, including their own families, and created a new kind of childhood lived in multiple, rapidly shifting networks. One inevitable result was anomie, or normlessness, because stable and binding moralities cannot form when everything is in flux‚Ä¶The phone-based life produces spiritual degradation, not just in adolescents, but in all of us‚Ä¶In 2010 there was little sign of a mental health crisis. Now it‚Äôs all around us.‚Äù

33,RGAVUWKBZKTQ1,Updated review after 100 days building small yet lasting habits.,"I previously wrote this review right after reading the book.  Today, February 15th, after applying James‚Äôs system for 100 days on a few tiny habits, I feel compelled to share updates with you because they have sincerely worked.

I will divide the review into 5 parts.  The first part is a summary of the book with short excerpts highlighted while taking notes.  Next, I hope to share pieces of advice that have motivated me while building new habits.  Following that, I will share how I implemented the first 3 habits throughout these months.  Then, some thoughts to whom I would recommend reading the book.  Last, there are 4 complementary readings.

SUMMARY

[Introduction]  James starts by sharing personal strategies he implemented to recover from a serious accident in high school.  That event forced him to improve the quality of his routine to get his life in order, coming to the conclusion that ‚Äúwe all deal with setbacks, but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits.  With the same habits, you will end up with the same results.  But with better habits, anything is possible.‚Äù

[Section I  :  The Fundamentals]

[Chapter 1]  Here we learn the power of compounding effect:  changes that seem small and unimportant at any given day will compound into remarkable results if we are willing to stick with them for months and years.  James explains that ‚Äúbreakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.‚Äù  Comparing to habits, he shows that bamboo can barely be seen during the first couple of years while the roots grow underground before exploding for almost 100 feet into the air in a few weeks.  From that perspective, we come to understand the best outcomes are generally delayed.

[Chapter 2]  Based on a 3-layer concentric circle behavior change model‚Äîdivided into outcome change, process change, and identity change‚ÄîJames explains that we should pay attention to our inner identity by focusing on beliefs, assumptions, and values.  ‚ÄúMany people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve.  This leads us to outcome-based habits.  The alternative is to build identity-based habits.  With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.‚Äù  The strongest changes, then, happen from inside out, starting from our identity, passing through the process, and ultimately changing the outcome.

[Chapter 3]  In this chapter we are introduced to a 4-step framework, which is composed of cue, craving, response, and reward.  James calls it 'The 4 Laws of Behavior Change'.  He then explains that we can think of each law as a lever that influences our behavior‚Äîwhen the levers are in the right positions, they create good habits effortless whereas when they are in the wrong position, it is nearly impossible.  Through examples, he explains that ‚Äúthe cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue.‚Äù  Together they create a habit loop that, when repeated many times, habits become automatic.

[Section II  :  Make It Obvious]

[Chapter 4]  A primer on how cues play a crucial role in predicting habit formation without consciously thinking about the outcomes.  Once our habits become so common, the cues associated with them become essentially invisible because they are deeply encoded.  If we want to create better habits, a good idea is to be aware of the cues.  James finishes up by sharing a strategy called 'Habits Scorecard'‚Äîa simple exercise to become more aware of our behavior on a daily basis.  We first write down a chronological list of our daily habits and, once we have a full list, we score each habit as an effective, ineffective, or neutral habit.  Besides noticing what is actually going on, we can notice if certain behaviors help us become the type of person we wish to be.

[Chapter 5]  The cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms, and the 2 most common cues are time and location.  When we make a specific plan for when and where we will perform a new habit, we are more likely to follow through.  Stacking our habits by pairing a new habit with a current habit is a form to connect our behavior to our own advantage.  An example when building a daily journaling habit would be: ‚Äúafter I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will journal for 5 minutes.‚Äù

[Chapter 6]  This chapter shows how our environment plays a crucial role in defining habit behaviors.  ‚ÄúGiven that we are more dependent on vision than any other sense, it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior.‚Äù  To build good habits, then, we should either make desirable cues obvious in our environment or build new habits in a new environment to avoid fighting against old ones.

[Chapter 7]  One of the most practical ways to break a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.  As James points out, ‚Äúit is easier to avoid temptation than resist it.‚Äù

[Section III  :  Make It Attractive]

[Chapter 8]  James explains how the modern food industry has created products that are more attractive and addictive to consumers, and by doing so he shows that the more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.  Every behavior that is highly habit-forming tends to be associated with higher levels of dopamine.  It is the anticipation of a reward that motivates us to take action.  ‚ÄúTemptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive.  The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.‚Äù

[Chapter 9]  ‚ÄúWe tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.‚Äù  That said, it is common to pick up habits and behaviors from our parents, peers, and colleagues.  There is also a tremendous internal pressure to comply with the norms of the tribe.  And, finally, we try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire success ourselves.  One of the best strategies to build better habits is to join a culture where the desired behavior is the normal behavior.

[Chapter 10]  To avoid unnecessary and detrimental cravings, we should highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit by making it seem unattractive.  ‚ÄúHabits are unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings.‚Äù

[Section IV  :  Make It Easy]

[Chapter 11]  ‚ÄúAll habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity.  Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.‚Äù  The key component is to pay close attention to the frequency we perform a habit, not much for how long we have been practicing it.

[Chapter 12]  Since every action requires a certain amount of energy, we are motivated to do what is easy.  By contrast, the more energy required, the less likely it is to occur.  ‚ÄúYou don't actually want the habit itself.  What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers.  The greater the obstacle, the more friction there is between you and your desired end state.‚Äù  That is why we should reduce the friction associated with our habits by creating a prosperous environment to make future actions easier.

[Chapter 13]  There are decisive moments that deliver an outsized impact every single day.  As James puts, these decisive moments are a fork in the road, sending us in the direction of a productive path or an unproductive one.  To avoid procrastination, the skill of 'Showing Up' says that we should start a new habit by taking baby steps, making it as easy as possible to take action.  ‚ÄúA new habit should not feel like a challenge.  The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first 2 minutes should be easy.  What you want is a gateway habit that naturally leads you down a more productive path.‚Äù  He calls it the 'Two-Minute Rule', meaning that new habits should take less than 2 minutes to do in the beginning.  Once the habit is established we can improve and master the finer details.

[Chapter 14]  In order to keep bad habits away is to make them difficult in the first place.  There are 2 interesting strategies to improve our future behavior.  [1] Make good choices in advance before we can fall victim to temptation in the future.  James gives a personal example by sharing that whenever he is looking to cut calories he will ask the waiter to split his meal and box half of it to go before the meal is served.  If, however, he waits for the meal to be served and tries to eat just half, that would never happen.  [2] Make onetime actions that can automate our future habits and deliver increasing returns over time such as buying a good water filter, unsubscribing from unwanted emails, moving to a friendlier neighborhood, buying a standing desk, or setting up automatic bill pay.

[Section V  :  Make It Satisfying]

[Chapter 15]  We should make sure to feel immediately satisfied after performing a new habit to increase the odds that the behavior will be repeated next time.  ‚ÄúThe human brain has evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.‚Äù  For that, we can add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run.

[Chapter 16]  Here we learn how to measure our progress by tracking our habits.  The immediate satisfaction it delivers‚Äîas mentioned earlier in Chapter 15‚Äîis one of the many benefits that standout.  Besides that, James says, ‚Äúwhen we get a signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path.‚Äù  The most basic format to track our habits is to get a calendar and mark an X each time we stick with our routine.  One of the most important passages of the entire book is as follows:  ‚ÄúIf you miss one day, try to get back into it as quickly as possible.  The first mistake is never the one that ruins you.  It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows.  Missing once is an accident.  Missing twice is the start of a new habit.  This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers.  Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work.  But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly.‚Äù

[Chapter 17]  In order to prevent bad habits and/or eliminate unhealthy behaviors, James says that we could either add an instant cost to the action or make it painful.  A habit contract is also another strategy to hold our accountability:  ‚ÄúIt is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don't follow through.  Then you find one to two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract with you.‚Äù

[Section VI  :  Advanced Techniques]

[Chapter 18]  We learn how to distinguish habits when genes may or may not influence our performance especially for competitive activities.  ‚ÄúOne of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills.‚Äù  James proposes us to set some time apart to explore new activities in the beginning, before shifting our focus to exploit them thoroughly.

[Chapter 19]  When we find the sweet spot of our ability we tend to learn best and fastest.  The ‚ÄòGoldilocks Rule‚Äô states that ""humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.  Not too hard.  Not too easy.  Just right.‚Äù

[Chapter 20]  One downside of certain habits, James explains, is that we may stop paying attention to the little details and errors.  To counterbalance that we should review and reflect on the process over time to remain conscious of our own performance.  Using a simple chart to convey his message, we learn that ‚Äúthe process of mastery requires that you progressively layer improvements on top of one another, each habit building upon the last until a new level of performance has been reached and a higher range of skills has been internalized.‚Äù

PERSONAL THOUGHTS

Reading the book twice helped me take better notes and capture details.  In the meantime, I thought about 3 simple strategies that could improve our adherence to new habits.  Let me share these strategies here with you, and in the following section, I will describe how I managed to cultivate the first 3 new habits upon reading the book‚Äîfollowing the system proposed by James together with these 3 strategies.

[1]  The first strategy is about determining a 'commitment time frame' to avoid excuses during this initial trial period.  A 1-month time frame is a fair commitment, choosing to start on the first day of the month to practice it every single day for a full month.  Just at the end of the period, I will take the time to reflect and evaluate the pros and cons.

[2]  The next one is to choose only 1 new habit each month.  In doing so we become familiar with the practice intentionally while we develop a sense of purpose.

[3]  Last, during the first month of any new habit, I noticed that if I spend time exploring the details and the benefits, my motivation stays high.  It doesn't only help us create better practices, but it is also inspiring to learn from others who have succeeded previously by adding the same habit into their lives.  Podcasts, articles, videos, books, online courses, tutorials, and blog posts are all good sources.

IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW HABITS

[Nov 1, 2018]  I had been wanting to journal on a daily basis for many years but that had never happened.  Although I have carried a notebook with me for quite a while, it has never worked as a real journal‚Äîa daily routine, when we sit down and write personal thoughts, intentions, and reflections at around the same time.  Instead, it has been mostly used to take notes during meetings, to write down ideas and thoughts, to express travel memories, and to doodle.  Today, after 3+ months, I haven't looked back once, and still can't believe it took me that long to start this daily habit.  During the first month, I read blog posts, watched videos, and even read a short and inexpensive book to foster my creativity.

[Dec 1, 2018]  I have been impressed by the physical capabilities we can develop through body movement.  Although yoga has been a special part of my life since I was 18, I hadn't given proper attention to handstands.  But now, after 2+ months practicing it every day, it is rewarding to see improvements on a weekly basis.  Again, I definitely recommend watching videos and reading tutorials to find your favorite method.  This is the perfect habit to stack at the end or in the middle of any physical movement practice you may enjoy.

[Jan 1, 2019]  By now we know the benefits of cold showers‚Äîranging from healthier skin appearance all the way to a more resilient perspective of the world.  I had previously taken cold showers for 3 months in 2017, but it was a ‚Äúgoal‚Äù mindset instead of a ‚Äúhabit‚Äù mindset.  After that trial I set aside and, although I have kept taking cold showers once or twice a week since then, I wished cold showers was the default mode.  Now, after 1+ month, I can't see myself taking warm showers.  After all, it is about intention.  Again, we can learn uncountable benefits of cold showers by reading success stories.  One of my inspirations was Wim Hof.  It isn't comfortable in the beginning of any chosen day, but after 3-4 minutes, both my breath and thoughts calm down.

Putting them together, these 3 habits don't take more than 30 minutes of my day.  While I spend about 10 minutes journaling and 10 more minutes practicing handstands, I save 5 minutes taking cold showers because I won't stay any longer than necessary.

RECOMMENDATION

[1]  First, if you have watched videos, listened to podcasts, read articles and books on habit formation and, after all that, you feel satisfied, then, please, save your money and time.

[2]  However, if you are like me, that even after reading a few books on building habits and having successfully added good habits to your life, feel that there is still room for improvement, this book can be a terrific addition.

[3]  Last, if you haven't spent much time and energy discovering a good system to build lasting habits while breaking bad ones, please, read this book.

COMPLEMENTARY READINGS

[1]  Game Changers, by Dave Asprey, exposed me to a wealth array of ideas/habits/tools that have helped me decide which new habit to build next.  The book is divided into 46 laws.

[2]  Essentialism, by Greg McKeown, helped me focus on less but more important tasks, giving clarity to what matters most.  This is especially interesting to break bad habits.

[3]  The Talent Code, by Daniel Coyle, brought more motivation when learning new skills based on the assumptions that we develop new talents through deep practices, finding our ignition identity, and having the right coach to guide us genuinely.  I read it many years ago, then, a few years back, I read his following book called The Little Book of Talent‚Äîwhich is perhaps even more to the point.

[4]  The Systems View of Life, by Fritjof Capra, enlightened my perspectives on how nature and living beings are systematically integrated.  It is a profound and slightly academic book that can complement Atomic Habits especially to tie together the 4-step framework into the feedback loop system.

I sincerely hope you, too, have fun while building new habits.

Take care,

34,R2B8T1OQ2OHN2C,"Huge toolkit of actionable, practical, organized strategies to build positive habits","I've read a lot of books on changing behavior and building habits and James Clear's  Atomic Habits is my new favorite. This book is different from others in the way it covers an enormous amount of ground in the larger area of self-improvement while seamlessly tying all these ideas back into the central theme of habits.

One of the core concepts in Atomic Habits is to focus on the small improvement. The impact a 1% improvement per day can make may appear negligible at first, but Clear makes a compelling argument that in the case of habits, thinking small produces the biggest results over time. &#34;Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement,&#34; explains Clear.

Over the months and years, the accumulated effect of small habitual daily behaviors is staggering. Early in the book we are also warned that this compounding works both ways, so we'd better make sure we're making it work in the positive direction, not for the negative.

This is a concept I was introduced to years ago under a different name - Kaizen - the Japanese term for continuous incremental improvement. What's different and new in this book is how the concept is applied specifically to building habits.

I found the information introduced in chapter two about behavior change at the identity level to be spot-on. You're also given a simple two-step process for changing your identity and this one idea alone is incredibly powerful.

In chapter three, we are introduced to the habit loop - cue, craving, response, reward - and we learn how to build good habits in 4 simple steps and break bad habits in 4 simple steps.

One of those steps to habit formation, which goes hand in hand with the 1% concept, is how to make it not only small, but easy. In the chapters that follow, this is exactly what you find out.

Other ideas of great value that stood out included, habit stacking (the best way to form a new habit), habit tracking, habit shaping and how to design your environment - physical and social - for habit building success. You learn the truth about self-control, how to stop procrastinating and how to use implementation intentions, temptation bundling and motivational rituals. The book is simply packed with actionable ideas, tactics and strategies.

Virtually every idea in the book is useful and resonated with me. While I may not agree that we should &#34;forget about goals,&#34; I agree with one of Clear's core principles in the book - that we must develop systems for change. If we only focus on goals and don't develop systems and a focus on the process, we risk falling into a number of goal-related traps which ultimately lead to stagnation. With the right systems, we're rewarded with continuous improvement on a lifelong journey of success.

Another difference between Atomic Habits and other books in this genre is that while it's based on science it doesn't bog you down with unnecessary details of the research. Clear's book is intensely practical, giving you a huge toolkit of organized and named strategies you can apply immediately to create and strengthen positive habits and stop the negative ones.

The book is conversational, and includes many interesting stories, making it easy to read - and hard to put down (I read it cover to cover in one day).

36,R1NY2SQG2SNPBO,Includes author's story for writing this book,"It was a nice surprise to read about the reason behind the writing of this book.

Another refreshing aspect is that the book covers how habits are formed, whether good or bad and how to keep the good ones.

As is my custom, when reading most books, is to read through the table of contents. When I came upon chapter 20 titled ""The Downside of Creating of Creating Good Habits"". So that's where I started but certainly not where I finished.

Although I'm only at the beginning of chapter 4, entitled ""The Man Who Didn't Look Right"", I'm finding it a very interesting and helpful read.

Atomic Habits consists of 306 pages which includes the index.

Another interesting aspect of this book is the Notes section. It contains a detailed list of notes, references and citations towards the back that covers each chapter.

Would I recommend this book. Yes and no. This should not be considered a quick read. It's a book that takes time to imbibe and practice otherwise, why bother.

I bought the book because of a friend's recommendation. I needed something more in changing my eating habits. To be certain, this isn't a diet book but rather an explicit way in going from bad habits to good ones. As I once heard, life's a journey because a trip is too short.

38,R36P0LLXASSM0T,Transforming Through Tiny Changes: A Deep Dive into 'Atomic Habits,"My journey with ""Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones"" has not just been enlightening, but it has been an absolute game-changer for my personal development. I began this exploration with a hint of skepticism and concluded with an undeniable realization of its potential. ""Atomic Habits"" is not just another self-help book; it's a guide, a mentor, and a blueprint that ignited my drive for growth in ways I never foresaw.

While it's nearly impeccable in its approach, there are a few nuances that could resonate differently with readers. Eager to provide an objective viewpoint, I'll dive into my thorough experience with this book, offering an insider's perspective on its profound layers. This review is packed with my praises, yet it also touches on areas where the content could be slightly refined for broader appeal.

üñ•Ô∏èüìö **Detailed Strategy Over Mere Concepts**: A refreshing twist in self-help literature: At first read, it's evident that ""Atomic Habits"" isn‚Äôt just about abstract concepts. Instead, it offers actionable strategies, a pivot from the norm that significantly influenced my approach to habit formation. Its emphasis on the power of compound growth resonates deeply, bridging the gap between mere knowledge and its practical application.

üí°üåô **Micro Changes, Macro Impacts**: Illuminating the potential of the minuscule: One of the standout features of the book is its emphasis on small changes leading to profound impacts over time. This concept is relatable, especially for those who've faced the daunting task of overhauling their lifestyles overnight. It‚Äôs these minor tweaks, consistently applied, that can shape destiny, a theme consistently echoed throughout the book.

üìöüéí **Science Meets Anecdote**: A Blend of Research and Real-Life Stories: James Clear masterfully intertwines scientific research with personal anecdotes, painting a comprehensive picture of habit formation. This duality provides both a theoretical foundation and relatable stories, enhancing the book's credibility and readability.

üï∂Ô∏èüñêÔ∏è **Crisp Presentation Coupled with Engaging Narration**: A Treat for Avid Readers: The coherent structure and lucid style of ""Atomic Habits"" are commendable. But the true gem is its captivating narrative, which ensures readers are glued from start to finish. It feels less like a study of habits and more like an enlightening conversation with a trusted friend.

üîã‚è±Ô∏è **Sustained Motivation as the Central Theme**: The Powerhouse of Habitual Evolution: The recurring theme of maintaining motivation is a testament to the book's holistic approach. By focusing on systems over goals, it provides readers with a blueprint for long-term success, making transient motivation bursts a thing of the past.

However, in the spirit of a well-rounded review, I'd like to touch upon a minor observation:

‚öñÔ∏èü§î **Overemphasis on Certain Concepts**: Repetition for Reinforcement, or Redundancy?: While the recurring themes reinforce the book's core concepts, there are instances where certain ideas felt slightly overemphasized. While some readers might find this repetition helpful, others might see it as a tad redundant.

Considering everything, ""Atomic Habits"" overwhelmingly earns its 5-star rating üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü. Any minor repetitiveness pales in comparison to the goldmine of insights this book offers. The meticulous research, relatable anecdotes, and actionable strategies make it a must-read.

To all individuals eager for personal growth and those on the fence about diving into the realm of habits, I wholeheartedly endorse ""Atomic Habits"". It promises transformative insights and practical tools to craft a better version of oneself. After all, don't we all seek a life of improvement, one habit at a time?

I extend my deepest thanks to you for investing your time in this comprehensive review.

It's challenging to create an environment that cues into your cravings and desire to build something new and make it obvious and attractive at the same time. It's a mental shift that requires intention and attention to opportunity for continuous growth.

40,R2XP2P7JPYMHH1,Distilled and clear ideas made into a simple system of behavior change. Top notch!,"I began reading this book with very high expectations and it did not disappoint. I, myself, am a big believer of the power of habits and have done a lot of research on the topic. Yet I learned a lot, especially the clarity with which the author presents his ideas. Big parts of the book were, in some sense, confirmation that I was doing things the right way, since I was oftentimes thinking ""oh yeah, that's similar to what I'm doing"". Still, parts of the book and strategies proposed were new to me and really helped add habit strategies to my toolbox. As mentioned though, the best thing about this book is the clarity with which the ideas are presented and the way they blend together.

This quote from the last chapter summarizes the ""Four Laws of Behavior Change"" (that the book is about) well: "" (1) Sometimes a habit will be hard to remember and you'll need to make it obvious. (2) Other times you won't feel like starting and you'll need to make it attractive. (3) In many cases, you may find that a habit will be too difficult and you'll need to make it easy. (4) And sometimes, you won't feel like sticking with it and you'll need to make it satisfying.""

Here's some of the notes I made while reading the book:
- Habits are like compound interest in self-improvement.
- Outcomes are a lagging measure of habits.
- The ""Valley of Disappointment"" is the period where you are putting in the hard work but still seeing no results. --> but remember, your work is not being wasted, it is being stored.
- You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.
- Your habits shape your identity and your identity shapes your habit. It's a feedback loop. (reverse causation for the nerds here)
- Make clear plans - Use the ""Implementation Intention"": When X happens, then I will do Y OR if Z happens, then I will do W.
- Use ""Habit Stacking"": After behavior X, I will immediately perform behavior Y OR If Z happens, I will immediately perform behavior W. (i.e. As soon as I begin boiling water for tea, I will do 10 burpees). Also, be very clear. (i.e. I will do the burpees next to the fridge in the kitchen, or whatever, you get the idea. As long as it works, it's good!)
- People with high self-control are the ones who structure their environments in such a way to minimize exposure to tempting situations.
- Use ""Temptation Bundling"" + ""Habit Stacking"": After X, i will Y. Right after Y, I will immediately Z,
where X - habit I already do, Y - habit I need to do, Z - habit I want to do. (The anticipation of a reward is what gives us the most motivation - and not the reward itself.)
- Do something you enjoy before a difficult habit.
- Planning can sometimes be a form of procrastination because it can make you feel like you are making progress (while you are not).
- Make your habits as easy as possible to start (i.e. do one set of abs, read one page of my book) - This is called a ""Gateway Habit"". and it helps to reinforce your identity of who you are which will itself help motivate you to keep going.
- Prime your environment for future use - ""resetting your environment"" (i.e. Take out your coffee and mug the night before, make your bed perfectly, to remove the sense of sleep / bedroom if you'll be working from your bedroom)
- Use pre-commitment devices to make it harder/ impossible to deviate from good habits.
- Even one minute of a bad habit (i.e. checking instagram) can manifest into a lot (i.e. getting lost in time browsing instagram).
- Put some immediate reward into good habits / immediate punishment to bad habits.
- Create a habit tracker / calendar to provide a sense of accomplishment and motivation.
- Rule: Never miss a habit twice! (life gets in the way, but don't let it derail you off your path)
- Finding what you are naturally gifted in will make good habits easier. To do that ask the following questions. (1) What feels like fun to me but work to others? (2) What makes me lose track of time? (3) Where do I get greater returns than the average person? (4) What comes naturally to me?
- You can also win by being different, by rewriting the rules (i.e. by combining your unique set of skills)
- Periodic reflection and review can enable the long-term improvement of all habits - identity building.

Finally, some quotes I liked:
- ""Really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.""
- ""The greatest threat to success is not failure, but boredom.""
- ""You have to fall in love with boredom.""
- ""Improvement is not just about learning habits, it's also about fine-tuning them.""
- ""Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine.""

And my favorite:

42,RDA919LLMMLIL,Atomic Habits will change your life! 9 takeaways:,"Atomic Habits by James Clear is one of those rare books that I immediately read twice in a row. It is filled with dozens of science-backed and actionable nuggets of wisdom. Do you want to improve any habits in your life? I heartily recommend Atomic Habits to you! We are all driven by our habits - many of which are unconscious. Below are 9 quotes and takeaways from this life-changing book:

1. ""Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run."" Atomic Habits explains why the little things you do every day matters. Your little habits matter. It may not seem like a big deal to skip a workout or to be kind, but it is a big deal. Imagine if you improved your habits by only 1% every day. You'd be dramatically a different person in a year. Then imagine if you let your habits decline by 1% every day. You'd be in a much worse spot in life overall a year from now. Your little habits - atomic habits - count for a lot in the long run. What little habits are you improving upon (or neglecting...) today?

2. ""You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."" This is such an important point in the book. Oftentimes we focus on goals in our life, while neglecting to focus on the systems that help us achieve goals. As an example, I had a friend who had the goal to complete a triathlon.  He achieved this goal!  And then he quit working out for the next year and got out of shape... He was so focused on achieving a goal that he neglected his underlying systems of being healthy. Goal achievement can actually set us back if we don't get set up sustainable systems.  Get the systems right and then we'll indeed also achieve our goals. Systems > Goals.

3. ""Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity."" I love this quote from the book. Every action - every habit - you take casts a vote for the type of person you want to become. Do you want to be a more organized person? When you develop habits and systems that organize your life, you are casting votes for thinking of yourself as an organized person. You think to yourself, ""hey, I'm an organized person."" And then you reinforce that belief with your habits and actions - a virtuous cycle! The flip side of this can be true too. What if you often show up late to meetings? You're casting votes that may make you think ""well, I'm just a person that is always late."" An un-virtuous cycle.  Be careful to make sure that your habits and ultimately your beliefs cast votes for the type of person you want to become and, indeed, who you truly are.

4. ""How long does it actually take to form a new habit? You just need to get your reps in."" Atomic Habits answers the question of ""how much time does it take to form a new habit"" with a better answer of : X number of actions.  Meaning, you may need to simply complete a new habit 100 times for it to stick, which could be done in 3 days or 3 weeks or 3 months, depending on the new habit. It is better to think of forming new habits in terms of consistently taking action, versus trying to stick to a habit for just X number of days. Get your reps in.

5. ""Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits."" The inverse of this is also true - increase friction between you and your bad habits! I think about this a lot when it comes to eating healthy. I need to reduce friction by having healthy food in the house and healthy snacks at work. And I need to increase friction by not having candy in the house or in my office! Out of sight, out of mind. In sight, and I eat it. :)  (which of course reminds me of the Dad joke I often tell my girls: ""I'm on a seafood diet. I see food and I eat it...)

6. ""Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do."" This is a powerful concept. I put this in practice by only ""watching TV"" when I'm on the treadmill. I am able to run at a 6 MPH pace and watch TV or videos on the iPad when I'm on a treadmill. So, I generally only watch sporting events or movies or 80s music videos on YouTube when I'm running on the treadmill. This approach actually allows me to run longer if I want to watch a full half of a game, for example. And 80s music videos will often give me the energy to run that extra mile. :)  Think about a new habit you want to start and how you can bundle it with an action you're already taking. Stack them together - i.e. habit stacking.

7. ""Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit streak and 'don't break the chain.'"" Atomic Habits does a nice job of explaining the importance of tracking your habits for success. What gets measured gets managed. One of my favorite habit trackers is a FitBit/Apple Watch, which tracks steps, heart rate, sleep, weight and can even track food intake/calories, if you input this data.  My behavior definitely changes thanks to these habit trackers. Atomic Habits gives you additional habit tracker resources.

8. ""Never miss twice. When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately."" We all will have days where we fall off the bandwagon and our habits go in reverse. Well, that's okay for one day. Don't let it happen twice. Get back on track as soon as possible. (And, yes, sometimes we miss a habit two days in row. Just don't let it become three days...)

I bought this book because my doctors don't understand or know this research, but without the references to the research, as a non doctor, I can't prove to them that what I know is correct (what do I know, I don't have a formal medical education or doctorate). I shouldn't need to redo her research so I have proof to share with my physician. There is a reference list by chapter, but again, it's a lot of work and I can't always access the articles without a paid subscription to research journals (hence the need to follow basic research writing guidelines).

For context, I'm 43 years old, have not felt right since my second/last pregnancy 11 years ago and have gone to doctors to be offered, you guessed it, anti-depressants and told, ""you're a mom."" Initially, I followed the WHOLE30 diet years ago and had wonderful success when combined with fasting.  Then, at 40.... nothing worked, I felt like I was going crazy, I work out, eat right, track everything.  Went to my annual gyn appt and was told, ""your labs are normal.""  I've cycled through crazy diets, I've worked out 2x/day, I've given up entire food groups.  With NO results.  I began following Dr. Haver's recommendations and while I feel better and am off medication, something was still off.

54,R19CJTTIYRDOJM,A Riveting Tale of Adaptation and Deception,"*Natural Selection* is an exhilarating and fast-paced short story that captures the essence of human resilience and adaptability. The story follows Sophia, a charming New Yorker, who finds herself entangled with JP, a Midwestern executive whose promises of love quickly unravel. The novel‚Äôs sharp observations and dynamic characters make it a compelling read.

Sophia‚Äôs journey is both heart-wrenching and enlightening. As she arrives in the Galapagos on a trip originally intended for herself and JP,she navigates the complexities of her relationship with JP, and she learns the hard truths about trust and adaptability. The recurring theme‚Äî‚ÄúIt is not the strongest of the species that survive, and it is not the most intelligent. It is the one most adaptable to change‚Äù‚Äîis brilliantly interwoven throughout the narrative. This idea resonates deeply as Sophia faces the shocking revelation of JP's deceit and the reality of his  life back home.

The narrative explores the contrast between Sophia‚Äôs adaptability and JP's inability to evolve. Sophia‚Äôs initial na√Øvet√© gives way to a poignant realization of her own strength and the necessity of change. The encounters with her shipmates add layers of complexity and highlight the struggles inherent in relationships where adaptation is not an option.

The book‚Äôs ending, where Sophia snaps a stunning photograph of a dolphin midair‚Äîa symbol of her own personal growth and transformation‚Äîis both metaphorically and visually striking. It‚Äôs a testament to the story‚Äôs powerful message about embracing change and learning from one‚Äôs experiences.

With its engaging plot and well-developed characters, *Natural Selection* is a must-read for anyone interested in a story about love, betrayal, and personal evolution.

74,R126AHZZIYIPST,WOW! Luis Elizondo is a brave national treasure.,"This book really provides a well documented overview of the behind-the-scenes struggle for UAP disclosure with some very revealing juicy details about the UAP phenomenon.

This topic is understandably a can of worms for the government and society at large. It raises more questions than answers, and I think it may be largely disturbing to the majority of the population. I believe this is why most people seem to go slightly unconscious when you talk to them about the topic. It‚Äôs almost as if it‚Äôs too much to consider and they‚Äôd rather not think about it. And really what could they do about it? So ignorance of the topic or feigning ‚Äúno interest‚Äù in the topic is sort of a psychological and perhaps unconscious coping mechanism for a large part of the population.

I think for many of us interested in this topic, it‚Äôs a sort of entertaining interest. But as I read through this book, you start to realize that there are some very serious implications.

It appears as though there‚Äôs a lot of evidence supporting the fact that a very technologically advanced superior species is engaging with our planet. That raises a lot of questions. Who are they? Where did they come from? Why are they here? What are their intentions?

And importantly, the powers that be do not want the public at large to know about this. That is a curious position. Why? You would think this information would be exciting to share, the biggest discovery of human history. One that could perhaps unite the planet around our shared humanity. Ironically, this information is considered top-secret and has been suppressed and denied at all costs.

The most plausible reason this has been done is for national security reasons, akin to the nuclear bomb. A race to reverse engineer this technology in order to achieve technological global dominance first, similar to the race to achieve artificial super intelligence. Once the technology was mastered, the US could then contemplate Disclosure - but not before the objective was achieved.

Besides, Disclosure might hamper these efforts and in an open society where the public would demand more and more information and details, which might accidentally tip our hand to our enemies and accelerate foreign adversaries programs to make contact, reverse engineer, and get there before us. And who‚Äôs to say these visitors wouldn‚Äôt ally themselves with some other nation and empower them ahead of the US, which could totally disrupt the balance of global power.

I suspect that this is a very difficult situation for the US government, or any global superpower.

I am for disclosing the truth, whatever that may be, however, I do empathize with the significance of the decision to do so. From a risk management perspective, the potential impacts could be existential to the existing global power structure.

As a thought experiment, imagine for example if North Korea, Russia, or China accelerated their UAP contact efforts, as a result of US disclosure, and made a breakthrough in contacting them, and the visitors empathized with them for some reason and decided to support and give them advanced technologies. Such an outcome changes everything.

I do believe the cat is out of the bag, and the likely course is a slow drip of increasingly more info. That seems to be the only course of action plausible.

Another option is for the government (or NASA) to reveal a monumental scientific discovery along the lines of the James Webb telescope discovering definitive signatures of life elsewhere in the universe. This could massively deflect the conversation away from UAP in our neck of the woods, galvanize scientists, resources and interest across the world, and completely deflect the conversation away from UAP for a while. It could also act as a sort of good faith, formal government soft disclosure in preparation for ultimate disclosure. This could buy them more time to work on reverse engineering the technology, without disclosing what they already know.

It‚Äôs safe to say that the future is going to be interesting.

I recommend you buy this book and buy a few extra copies to share with friends and family. It‚Äôs a very exciting read and hard to put down. Great job to Lou Elizondo, Christopher Mellon, and all those involved.

80,R20E225W5V5BVQ,It‚Äôs real,"I‚Äôm an avid reader, yet have never left a book review. Wow!  Let‚Äôs face it, many of us have surmised that something is going on. Mr. Elizondo put everything on the line to bring this information to light. I have thought for a few years, that not only have the sightings increased, but also, the reporting is more detailed & thorough, with less ridicule.  It‚Äôs almost as if the USGOV is now allowing certain leaks, so as to prepare us, yet not inundate us all at once.
Mr. Elizondo felt he had no choice. He risked his reputation & future employment to bring this to light.  He was hit by wall of arrogance & bureaucracy at the Dod.  They retaliated with a smear campaign to sully his name.  If you google his name, he is still described as a ‚Äúconspiracy theorist‚Äù.  What a disgraceful show of arrogance, malice and petty spitefulness, shown by the Dod. Thank God he had some very loyal and like minded scientists/intel experts who refused to forsake him.

The book brings in the many other scientists and intel professionals by name, to add additional credence to the subject. The science is sometimes difficult, but is presented in a manner which one can grasp.  I found myself setting down the book to research the many unclassified documents that are referred to.

81,REWNEU81773F7,Interesting. Bizarre claims. Maybe they're true.,"I've been following this phenomenon since I was a kid. It's incredible that there is so much mainstream attention on this unusual and typically fringe topic.

I don't know if I buy some of the claims in this book. Regardless, very credible US military pilots, intelligence officers, former high ranking officials, reputable scientists and current politicians think UAP's are real, are not man-made, and are constantly flying around our nuclear power and weapons sites. The US Congress believed the topic was important enough to codify into law what they call ""disclosure."" This mandated disclosure by the Department of Defense and other government entities includes sharing with the American public any knowledge of retrieved, deceased non-human pilots and abandoned or crashed craft not made by humans and technologically superior to our current military tech. It appears we're talking hundreds or even thousands of years ahead of our capabilities.

There must be something to these stories if Congress passed legislation and presidents recently signed them into law. So far, a few others aside from Elizondo have come forward, but the DoD, certain politicians and weapons contractors are still stonewalling per Elizondo.

At this point, the tangible proof isn't available to us because everything is ""classified,"" although congresspeople have been able to hear the testimony of witnesses and those that have direct knowledge of this stuff (some testified in SCIFs, where classified info can be discussed with authorized officials).

The US Government also has radar and other sensor data, and compelling but grainy video released by the DoD in 2017.

If Elizondo is to be believed, there's a fundamentalist Christian cabal keeping us from knowing the truth. ""The Legacy Program"" is a allegedly a conspiracy between major military contractors and entrenched government officials who don't want us to know that we are not alone in the universe -- and that they possess non-human bodies as well as exotic craft made by non-human intelligence which we've been trying to reverse engineer and weaponize for 70 plus years.

I think Elizondo has done some great work over the years for his country, and if some or all of his claims are true, this is probably the most explosive knowledge in human history. It would mean that we are not the only intelligent life in the universe, and somehow other intelligent lifeforms (or space-faring drones of non-human origin) have mastered the ability to travel the cosmos faster than the speed of light. Also, it seems these beings are treating us like zoo animals, or they may be assessing our abilities for the impending interspecies/galactic war. If they are, with their seeming capabilities we're kind of screwed.

If you're knowledgeable about ""UFO lore,"" you'll know most of what's disclosed in this book. But it's still a fascinating read.

I am in a public position so to speak about my experience might have brought ridicule.

But, in 2018 I decided to publish my truth, and I feel like Mr. Elizondo has pierced that painful boil  of depression, indignation by others and my being called a ""crackpot"" repeatedly. Yet, everything I have ever offered in this regard is true. When I came to the attention of the Intelligence Community for my experience via very respected researchers at the NAVY, I found what Mr. Elizondo refers to in the book: ""If you don't understand something the best course is to deny it exists."" When it is life or death I don't think that applies.

I am very thankful for this book. I would like to mention two names associated with this research, George P. Hansen who patiently took my story over a period of years including parts in his massive (DoD funded) ""The Trickster and the Paranormal"" and the truly legendary John A. Keel who was known as the world foremost Fortean (named after Charles Fort). Keel sought me out in 1982, and I acted as his agent, friend and counselor until his untimely death at age 70 in 2009.  I mention these names because without credentials these men pursued the same phenomenon, and ran into everything noted in this fantastic and clear book.

I feel relieved, even if humanity has barely heard the wake up call of the cosmos. I pray the world reads this book and profits therefore. Thank you very much Luis Elizondo.

93,R1B8HFCJFF2G3M,Totally Captivating!!,"Wow! It has been a LONG time since I have actually felt tension while reading a book. I can read the biggest action scenes at the end of various books and the majority of the time they just don't affect me at all - because I don't care that much about the characters. But THIS - this was different. I felt the tension. And it was real. Plus the author is very willing to kill characters so there is some uncertainty there as well. And the battle at the end of this most excellent book - it was hot and raging. Plus the enemy leaked danger as well. True menace. Very rarely does some enemy in a book impress me at all but this one most certainly did.. Right from the description I just KNEW there was something different about these mages called venin. They seemed impressive too. And very memorable. I wanted to draw them based off of the description. Very rarely do I get that urge.

But what a battle at the end! It was touch and go. What would happen? Would the heroes win or lose? I didn't know. And I felt concern.

This book has made me feel things. Earlier it had made me cry - tears of joy.

And the book has surprised me too. The plot twists! I guess I should have seen it coming but I didn't so I was quite surprised. But it certainly makes the story way more interesting! And I am certainly eager to read the sequel too! This is a massive book and worth reading every word! And rarely do I feel that way. But its exciting and the characters face so many challenges. And there is death too. In fact there is a lot of death in here. Its a very violent world, a tough world of dragons and griffins and things that are supposed to be only legends to scare kids to eat their vegetables...

But what I love the most in here in the main character Violet. She has a connective tissue disorder. I have one too (its called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome - EDS - and I am pretty confident that Violet actually has EDS). I have never run across a character in a book before that has EDS. And certainly not one that is bold enough to be in a fantasy world where she rides a dragon. How cool is that? So yes I certainly can relate to her very well! And so much of the stuff in here is quite accurate too. Exercise is the best way to protect the joints (and personally I find diet matters a ton too). And yes it certainly can make many things way harder. The joints are all wonky and they naturally hyper-extend so doing things - even just balancing - is way harder. But riding a dragon!!! I remember when I was much younger I used to read this other very popular fantasy series that included dragons and I used to try to imagine what it would be like to ride a dragon. Of course I never thought about the issues of staying ON said dragon... But since I ride horses these days I have a better idea of some of the issues. But wow this book is totally AMAZING! it totally captivated my attention. The first evening I started it I got 50% through. And I certainly would have powered through the second half yesterday but unfortunately I have packing to do as I am moving at the end of the month.

If I could I would rate it 6 stars!

The characters are just so real. And they go through character arcs too. They change. They face obstacles and have to find solutions. And there is certainly a bit of romance in here too. The story moved so smoothly. Never a dull moment at all. None. And I just loved the first person writing in here from Violet's viewpoint.

But the story is about a young woman named Violet who has been forced by her very powerful mother to become a dragon rider. That is a warrior. But her body is weak and ill suited for it. So she was training to be a scribe (but all of that writing would be a huge strain on her too - in fact I cannot write very long at all by hand anymore without pain + numbness going down my arm and I get horrid shoulder pain) but that changed - she had to go be a dragon rider or die trying. But its not that easy in fact its very dangerous. Most people who try to become a rider end up dead. And you can be killed by your own classmates! Yes, its a very brutal school. And after all of these difficult obstacles - which Violet is ill suited to pass - she has to hope that a dragon will pick her. But what dragon will pick someone with a body that doesn't work right due to genetic mutations?

And all of that is near the beginning of the book! For a huge mysterious and dangerous problem is brewing in the Kingdom! And poor Violet will run smack into it - err - fly into it. If she can stay on the dragon that is...

4/5üå∂Ô∏è

i have nothing but good things to say about this book, buckle up.
i‚Äôm honestly not even sure that i will be able to gather my thoughts and form a coherent review to adequate explain how much i adored this book but i‚Äôm going to try. let‚Äôs start by saying that i am obsessed with this book.
this was outstanding and amazing in every single way. i cried, i laughed, i giggled, i gasped, i did ALL THE THINGS. i have not felt so many things while reading a book since my last SJM read. fourth wing absolutely deserves all the hype and more. if the hunger games, divergent, harry potter, and game of thrones had a baby, this would be it.
this book was the perfect mixture of romance and high stakes and the vibes were so spot on. fourth wing is fast paced from beginning to end and will absolutely hook you from the very first chapter. the world building was perfection and so seamless that it never felt awkward and i was never confused about the fantasy world. this is a world i would absolutely love to live in!
i have heard that a lot of people found this book predictable, but i‚Äôm personally HORRIBLE at predicting endings so i may have forseen one or two things but i definitely could not have predicted the entire ending for this book and that made it that much more enjoyable.
i LOVED violet‚Äôs character so much. her bond with her sister and her friends was so genuine. she is tough and strong willed and is unstoppable, despite her disadvantage (which yarrow displayed SO SO well). i loved her journey and how much she grew throughout this whole book.
XADEN!!!! rhysand has been my #1 book boyfriend since i devoured ACOTAR last year and no one has lived up to the hype since. xaden freaking riorson has officially take my #1 book boyfriend spot with rhysand as a very close second. how can you not love this man?? he is an ABSOLUTE SIMP from violet even from the start despite his grumpy exterior. men who show their love through actions >>>
this man had me literally gasping and giggling like a little kid because of some of the things he did. he was exactly what violet needed. i loved their tension but also how he always believe in her. and the nicknames?? ü§≠
the romance was perfection. usually i get really impatient with slow burns, but the fantasy aspect of this book was done SO WELL that i was such as obsessed with the story as i was with the romance. and enemies to lovers??? sign me tf up. üòÆ‚Äçüí® violet and xaden had the perfect build up between them. and the SPICE?? puh-lease. absolutely amazing!!
tairn and andarna were hands down, the best part of this book. yarros did SO GOOD with described all of the details of the dragons and giving them so much personality. the interactions between the dragons and their riders were so much fun. i loved tairn‚Äôs grumpy exterior, his sassy comments, and how protective he was of violet. andarna is so freaking cute and i love her to death.
i could honestly rave about every single aspect of this book but i feel like this really sums up some of my biggest feelings. this is definitely a book that deserved ALL the hype and definitely a book that you need to read, even if you aren‚Äôt a fantasy lover.
this book was not perfect by any means. like anything else, this book had flaws but it was perfect to me. i am obsessed. it had everything i wanted from a fantasy book AND DRAGONS!!üêâ i cannot wait to get my hands on iron flame!! this is definitely a book that i will be rereading before book 2 comes out! i know for a fact that this will be the best book that i read for this year.

The world building, the story telling, the character building are so gorgeously and breathtakingly good, that I am desperate for the next book. If you like a love story, adventure, magic, deception, you will love this book.

Sent to learn to be a dragon rider by her mother, the general, Violet enters a world she‚Äôs unprepared for. She‚Äôs weak, trained in history, a scribe at heart, she‚Äôs not a warrior. And yet, we watch her transform, taking strength from her honor and her will to do good.

97,R3OIM5W64IJ60U,A little to predictable,"So imagine you get dressed up your finest clothing and you‚Äôre going to go out to one of the expensive restaurants in town. This restaurant is not cheap it cost more money than the average run of the mail place, but it‚Äôs supposed to have superior food.  You get there you have an appetizer you have a meal you have a dessert and you leave feeling like it was average.  That‚Äôs how I feel after I read this book. It was just average. Don‚Äôt get me wrong. There were some good parts to the story. The beginning was good. The end was good, but there was far too much predictability. I really felt like having I read this sort of similar dragon rider tale before or have I seen these plot points touched upon before.  I could see where certain things were going well before they got there. Not that I predicted everything but too much of this was predictable.  No I did not want to give the book 3 stars so I didn‚Äôt go that low, but it deserves about 3.5 stars to be honest.  For the $14.99 I paid for this book digital on Kindle. It cost too much for the story I got.  Here‚Äôs the funny thing. I actually want to read the next book in the series. It‚Äôs not that it‚Äôs a bad story but for $15 it should be a great story and so far it‚Äôs just average. There is room for improvement. the characters are nice. I can see this growing into something better but this first book Was not a Homerun.

Message to the author

Spoilers follow warning. Once again, spoilers be warned.

I always write a message to the author when I read a book that is interesting to me. Now I am a fan of the dragon writer genre. I‚Äôm a fan of fantasy and LITRPG books so I can get down with any story and I look for the good ones. I saw the reviews I saw the price and I was willing to pull the trigger and pay $15 for this story. I believe authors should be paid properly for their work. I‚Äôm a little sad to say the $15 I paid for this digital book doesn‚Äôt quite live up to my expectations. The plot was easy to follow. The grammar was perfect and spot on no misspellings. Nothing like that instead I found the story just predictable. It was easy to see who the heroin would bond with. Wow there‚Äôs a big dragon she‚Äôs going to be with him. It was unexpected that she would get two dragons. There‚Äôs a mysterious rebel that wants her dead. I bet they‚Äôll end up a couple. Guess what it happened.  Now the end was not as predictable. I know some people who would‚Äôve thought it was predictable to see him leading a rebellion with the griffins, but I didn‚Äôt see that coming perhaps because I wasn‚Äôt looking for it, but I didn‚Äôt know what would happen at the end truly. However, it was easy to see that her mind had been read as soon as I realized he touched her. I said Dain knows something he shouldn‚Äôt. It was easy to see he would be the one to break her trust and do something he shouldn‚Äôt. It was also clear someone would die and the only question was would it be Liam or her gf?  The world was a nice world to be in. The characters were nice characters to read about, but they were just too predictable.  One final note the love scenes were well written often I read authors who don‚Äôt know how to describe passion in a book, but this was very tasteful. What was repetitive were the feelings that kept being repeated over and over and over and over again. There‚Äôs only so many times I want to hear how attracted she is to him. Even when we were given a different mindset at the end of the story man I already knew how attracted he was to her. I didn‚Äôt need to hear it so many times it was just too much. I realized they are young teenagers who really want each other, but I don‚Äôt need to hear it every five minutes in the book.

I‚Äôm a bit unsure if I will purchase the next book in the series, I definitely want to read it since that final scene in the book occurred but I‚Äôm a little scared to pay $15. I think the prices for this series needs to be adjusted.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OIM5W64IJ60U,jermel purse,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2024",True,15 people found this helpful,B0BVDJ293G,,,

Oh, my goodness this book is captivating!  It had me hooked from the beginning!

Let's get into it!

Violet - Love her! She is super smart and figures things out quickly. She is witty and spunky. She loves and protects so many people. She makes so many friends along her journey and protects them ever chance she needs to. She finds friends from her past, Dain. (Which I'm sorry if you do like him, I didn't like him from the very beginning.) Then she finds, Rhiannon, Ridoc, Liam, Sawyer and more. Even with Jack, he was a total ass to her, crazy trying to kill her and she still felt bad that she killed him to protect her friend.  She stays in her own lane and works hard to prove that she can be a rider. To prove to her mother and everyone else that she can and will. So, she conquers all of these challenges. She becomes a rider! Not only does she pair with one dragon but two! Tarin and Andarna! To add Tarin is mated to a dragon Sgaely which is Xaden's dragon! Connect Violet and Xaden even more than the automatic connection they already have.  Let's talk about that! The one person she is told to stay away from is the ONE GUY she falls for!! Of course, kind of an enemies to lovers going on. Yay! I instantly love Xaden and Violet together. Even when she kept thinking he was going to kill her.  I thought no way they're going to end up together or connected one way or another.

Xaden - Total bad-boy vibes, of course.  But hides his true feelings for Violet. Also, the fact that he took over the full responsibility of all the rebel children and had them in scripted into Basgiath to either prove loyalty becoming riders and fight for Navarre or die trying. Better than all of them being killer because their parent were rebels. He is a complete protector, he protected Violet every chance he was given but also hid it very well. I am annoyed that he had to be hiding some kind of secret! Why couldn't he just tell her everything?? I mean truly I get why he didn't but why? lol. Then this whole time he was hiding his true feelings from her. But then it comes out at the very end when he thinks she is going to die.

Other side notes:

Back to Dain for a bit.  I don't like him. He is annoying and is always try to ""protect"" Violet but in a way that is whiny and trying to bring her down. His power is to see someone's memory. He secretly uses it on her to see what she knows about Xaden. Then he tattletales on them to his dad. Ugh. I. Don't. Like. Him.

So, Violet gets two dragons. Andarna and Tarin is mated to Xaden's dragon Sgaely. That also makes it so Xaden and Violet can mind speak to each other. and Violet can also communicate with Sgaely. Then with both their signet powers they are one badass couple. Xaden (shadows), Violet (lightening). Also, how their dragons cannot be away from each other for more than 3 days.  I am excited to see where this goes.

Liam! I am so sad that we lost Liam. I cried so much when all of that happened. I was hoping so way that Violet could freeze time like she could with Adarna but I never did. Not only did she lose a great friend, but Xaden also lost a brother. It was so sad. I'm definitely going to miss his character.

So, Xaden and some of the other rebels and dragon were working with gryphons and their fliers. Enemies of Navarre. They are giving them weapons to help fight the venin and wyvern. Violet is completely in the dark about this until the end of the book.  These people she thought were a complete fantasy. Her father told her stories from a book, he leaves her a hidden letter in the book basically telling her that these people and creatures are real, and their government is hiding the truth from their people.  Then at the very end of this book someone believed to be dead is actually ALIVE! He is part of the rebellion! I knew something happened at the end due to other people's reactions, but I never thought that, that would be it! definitely a good twist!

I cannot wait for November when the 2nd book comes out!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RY1UJZHPEX09Y,Ryan Harris,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/0f58b097-ac8e-49ed-911f-b8442e28806c._CR0,0,500,500_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2023",True,70 people found this helpful,B0BVDJ293G,,,
101,R31AUW1SOGRSNI,"So Much Cringe, But High Entertainment Value","""You turned oranges into a weapon, Violence?"" - Xaden Riorson

High fantasy, dragons, and an enemies-to-lovers romance in a world wrought with war? YES PLEASE! Okay, let's start at the beginning, the part before I even start reading the book. Fourth Wing is everywhere: Bookstagram, BookTok, everyone and their mother AND brother have read Fourth Wing. I was interested. I had been putting it off for fear that it would disappoint. Well...when I started reading, I was thinking ""Yeah, a nice new young adult fantasy with dragons. I hope it's as good as Eragon!"" Yes, I know I know...I found out very quickly that this is an adult fantasy and definitely NOT young adult. I could tell by the type font and layout, as if the sexuaI innuendos weren't enough right from the get-go! And man...were some of then so cringy. What force on this planet made me even think it was young adult?!¬†

Some of the innuendos and just the bickering, bantering type of dialogue was so cringy and awful that I had to read parts aloud to my husband for a serious laugh. It was like twelve-year-olds who have heard about $ex but haven't experienced it trying to talk about it. It was awful. Cringy. So terrible that I was affronted that I was still enjoying the book! One of the lines I remember most was something like ""I want to climb him like a tree."" Okay. I get what she means...but if you picture that particular simile...what DOES that even mean? There were better choices out there than...a tree...ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Cringe aspect incoming: While I love a good enemies-to-lovers trope, in fact one of my favorites, the way this was set up made the characters feel flatter than paper. We have our main character, Violet, whose small size is constantly emphasized for a good portion of the novel. Yes, thank you for telling us for the FORTIETH TIME that she is small and petite. Point taken. Cool. She is also warned early on about the traitor son, Xaden Riorson, who from the moment he sees her, emphasizes his need to kill her. Except...every time he has the chance, there's some dumb excuse as to why he didn't. And then all of a sudden, he's saving her from death MUTIPLE times, and then they are kissing. ‚öîÔ∏è This is all well and good, or would be, IF there was more to the enemy aspect. There should have been more time taken to explore Xaden's own hatred of Violet, and vice-versa.

At least it gets better. After about halfway through the book (roughly page 250), the cringe isn't there anymore. It's like the author became a better writer AS she was writing. The (human) characters finally started getting some dimension to them, and the cringe-worthy dialogue (with one exception about measuring size, though it's placement wasn't too bad) was no longer present. We finally get a little bit of Xaden's hatred-turned-passion toward Violet, but still not enough to see why he would want to kill Violet, as opposed to attempting to kill her mother, the main responsible party for his misery, instead. I know there will be more books to explore this later, but to make the true enemies-to-lovers feel, and for it to feel genuine, there should have been a bit more from the start.¬†

What truly makes this book shine is the dragons. Absolutely everything about the dragons. The series is named after their mysterious governing council (or what it is perceived as, though may be something else entirely), the Empyrean. The dragons are intriguing characters who all deserve more page time, especially Andarna and Sgaeyl, as well as the secondary characters dragons, which we don't get to see a whole lot of. With the dragons having their own governing system and being respected as the highest of beings, they certainly deserved more. The dragons also channel magic into their riders, and each rider manifests their own unique power based on their inner self. The magic system is enjoyable and works well for this world.

There are two parts about the book that absolutely make it phenomenal: Threshing, and the last 50 pages of the novel.

Threshing is the day when riders get to go out into the field and try to bond with a dragon. The dragon must pick the rider, of course, and not the other way around. No spoilers, but this scene comes somewhere between pages 120-180ish and is the part of the novel that truly had me hooked. I couldn't put it down!¬†

The last 50 pages of the novel are the exciting battle one waits for in this kind of book. Once again, no spoilers, but with references throughout and the multiple reveals during this stretch of reading make for an action-packed cliffhanger ending making the reader itch for more. I don't even know where this story will go from here. I know whatever happens, I'll be along for the ride and I know I'll have my wildest imaginings blown out of the water.

Final consensus:¬† ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êüíé
Why? Overall, the entertainment value of this novel has great sway in my final rating. Despite complaining about cringey aspects, they offered great laugh-out-loud moments. Despite the flat characters at first, they definitely fill out a bit more later, and the thing is, one can't hate on that. It's only the beginning of the story (my understanding at the time of this blog post is that it is planned as a five book series). That dragons truly make this book phenomenal, and everything about the last 50 pages really brought this novel to become something more, to put forward the promise to an exciting war story with its fair share of romance...and loss. Yes...I even teared up a bit at one part. No matter what anyone tells you about the book, its entertainment value makes for a FIVE STAR DIAMOND of a novel... i.e. a MUST READ for all fantasy lovers and seekers of a top-tier book with dragons.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31AUW1SOGRSNI,Terri,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/2614cef0-eebf-41de-b416-7bfc4f0dc224._CR48,0,403,403_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2024",True,37 people found this helpful,B0BVDJ293G,,,
102,RMLG5BBD2CJAQ,I NEED THE SEQUEL RIGHT MEOW!,"John Palladino, author of the grimdark fantasy series, The Tragedy of Cedain, picked this book for me to read. He said he'd heard a lot of people say good things about it, but the people he trusted absolutely hated it. He wanted to know what I thought. So here we are.

What do I think? I started this book and became obsessed. For the three days it took me to read it, I was either curled up in my chair physically reading it or suffering through the audiobook when I had to actually get up and function as an adult.

I would recommend reading this one physically, if possible. I had the good fortune to land both FOURTH WING and IRON FLAME in hardback during a sale in recent months. As is my habit, I checked out the audiobook from my library so that I could pair the two together. Rebecca Soler is the narrator and I did not enjoy her narration at all. Well - there is one exception - during certain scenes, Soler did match the pacing of the scene with her narration, and infused it with emotion that I felt truly captured the intensity of the moment. So there's that.

I loved so many of the characters in this story. Even though the book description warned me that the only way to leave this war college was to graduate or die, I still fell in love with these kids and rooted for them to conquer each challenge faced and survive to the end. It may surprise you fantasy readers out there to know that I favored the human characters over the dragons in this book. Don't get me wrong - the dragons were magnificent and I loved learning the little bits of history they shared and most especially loved learning about their magic and how it changed, based on their chosen Rider. It's been two days since I finished the book and I'm still in the horrible throes of a book hangover. (Thank goodness I already have the next book on hand to start soon!)

What I loved most about FOURTH WING was the setting. Even though there were a few deaths - one in particular - that devastated me, I wouldn't change a thing. This war college where young adults enter with the intent to become a Dragon Rider had a staggeringly low success rate. First, you have to survive the entrance to the Rider Quadrant. If you successfully navigated that, you were officially a cadet. Cadets then began their first year of training where they must survive challenges, training, education, fellow students and even the dragons! Just because you completed everything to a point, the dragons could reject you. (Hopefully by simply ignoring you and not with fire)

I was engrossed with the magic that was bestowed upon the Riders from their dragons. The dragons were able to channel magic through their bond to the Rider and the abilities manifested in different ways, depending on the Rider. Who the Rider was at their core - the kind of person they were - matched their magical abilities. I know the magic in this book was just brushing the surface, so I'm looking forward to continuing the series to see how it continues to build and seeing if the Riders' magic evolves further.

Obviously, this is a fantasy romance, so I feel like I should mention my opinion on the love story between our main characters. I liked it! It felt like the type of romance a couple of young 20-somethings would have, especially in a setting where they literally might not survive the day. It was quick, full of fire and flat out consuming. So many rant reviews I've seen focus on the ""horny dragons"" - I'm confused why people picked out that one scene that only took up a couple pages and what happened between the dragons took place off the page. I mean, how else do you think baby dragons get made?

In closing, I had a great time with this book and CANNOT wait to get started on the sequel. I'm at war with myself because I want to read it immediately, but then I also want to wait a bit closer to when the next book releases in early 2025.

""All the Colors of the Dark"" does have some minor flaws in my opinion.
First, it is very long.  Admittedly, it is a pretty easy read and goes quicker than you would expect a 600-page book to go, but the thought of that many pages will be off-putting to some.
The author breaks into this strange affectation from time to time during high-stress or action sequences where the writing becomes choppy and hard to follow. I understand it's to add drama or realism to the scene but, on several occasions, I was flipping pages back and forth and checking to see if I missed a page because it was hard to understand what had happened.
The story stretches over a long period of time and it almost gets lost.  The author does a good job of pulling it all together but it felt a little anti-climatic.
The book blends several genres which some will like and others may not.
The good:
The characters are wonderfully written.
There are enough plot twists to keep you guessing.
The author avoids clich√©s very well.
All in all, I really enjoyed this book.  Will it be the best book of 2024? Maybe.

That being said, the things these characters endured and suffered left me breathless and I NEEDED to get to the end. It was a page turner because I just had to know. I liked the style of writing, though I do agree this book could have been a little more condensed. Otherwise, these characters have my heart. ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** A few dislikes I had: I hated that Saint felt forced into marrying Jimmy. I hated the disregard Patch had for Saint for nearly the entire book - he came back because of her, and yet despite his gratitude left her in the dust so to speak (while continuing to use her as a resource and her voicemail as an emotional dumping ground). Her unwavering devotion and love for him was never returned equally, though he very clearly loved her as a close friend. His connection with Misty left me upset and nauseous. Like Saint said she could have anyone, why him? Her death brought more despair to an already upsetting tale. His obsession with Grace also left me feeling unsteady but I could at least understand his need to find her as she helped him survive. I understand there were uplifting parts - the art, the missing girls, the connections made - and yet I still found so much of this story hard to swallow. Why am I still giving this 4 stars?

118,R3SN1JWFNRN3GA,Outstanding!!,"ALL THE COLORS OF THE DARK by Chris Whitaker

I read this and listened to the audiobook narrated by, Edoardo Ballerini, who always does an outstanding narration.  He is a favorite narrator of mine and I highly recommend the audiobook.

In 1975 in the small town of Monta Clare, in the Ozark mountains of Missouri, young girls are gone missing.  When a girl from a wealthy family is being attacked, Patch, a thirteen-year-old boy with one eye who pretends he is a pirate, happens to be in the area and saves her from being taken. What follows changes Patch‚Äôs life and others in this small town. This well crafted powerfully written novel is part thriller, suspense, crime fiction, coming-of-age, love story, and Bildungsroman (new word for me, and describes it perfectly).

Patch and Saint, a teenage girl, are the two main characters and have a very special bond of friendship.  This novel unfolds over decades as Patch and Saint, navigate their teenage years into adulthood.  Both Patch, Saint, and others in this small community live out their lives, forever changed by the tragic events of one year.  This complicated story touches on serial killer violence, obsession, loyalty, kindness, memories, dreams, hope, and so much more.

I found myself getting lost in the pages of this beautifully written, character-driven story that I didn‚Äôt want to end.  This book blew me away, and by far my most favorite read of 2024 thus far.

121,R8KD93BASGE40,Will Love and Hope Prevail or is All Lost?,"This novel is many things: it is about a serial killer, love gained and lost, art, kidnaping and hope. It is a literary novel written in short chapters that gives the reader such a real sense of the characters that you could swear you know them.

Patch, at the center of the novel, is a young boy when he saves a girl from being kidnaped. He got his name from the fact that he has only one eye and wears a patch like a pirate. He has a best friend, a girl named Saint, and together they are a powerful pair.

Despite Patch being hailed as a hero for saving the girl, he has been traumatized by the fact that when he saved her, the kidnaper took him instead and Patch found himself locked up in a dark, dark room with a girl named Grace. Once he is found and released, thanks to the unwavering efforts of Saint, there is no sign of Grace. People wonder if she is just a figment of Patch's imagination. He is sure that Grace is real and will stop at nothing to find her.

Patch comes from a small community in Missouri called Monta Clare. It is a peaceful and lovely place without any crime until the serial killer goes there to seek his victim. The people in the community all know one another and they are shocked by the intrusion of such horrible crime.

Patch and Saint remain friends but Patch is obsessed with finding Grace. He will stop at nothing, legal or illegal, in order to find her. Her words echo in his mind and she has become part of his heart. Nothing can compete with his search for her.

This novel is about love and hope, along with the challenges people face when trying to secure these things in their lives. As Chris Whitaker states in the novel, ""To love and be loved was more than could ever be expected, more than enough for a thousand ordinary lifetimes.""

The bottom line is that this is a LARGE atlas that's purposely designed to be easier to read, which has some downsides. As you'll see, some pros are also cons.

PROS: (1) Easy to read. (2) Good quality print and a decent amount of detail for a general atlas. (3) The spiral binding should theoretically make it more durable. (4) It includes major cities/towns for each state as well as a national parks. CONS: (1) States are split between multiple pages, which makes it more challenging to follow some roads/routes since they don't always line up. This can be confusing and annoying and takes extra effort. (2) At a hefty 2.8 pounds, this atlas is quite large and heavy and some people might find it inconvenient and less than ideal to use. (3) While the spiral binding makes it easier to open the atlas and keep it open, if you're not careful turning the pages, you can easily rip them. (4) The maps of major cities/towns are not very detailed and just offer a basic idea of their layout at best. (5) Some detail is missing when looking at smaller roads in remote areas. If you require such fine detail for your travels, you will need a more specialized atlas like the Benchmark Road & Recreation Atlas or the Delorme Atlas & Gazetteer.

Overall, this is a good general road atlas that's definitely useful when planning road trips.

This memoir demonstrates, ‚Äú‚Ä¶ when you‚Äôre in the arena, you have to be able to take a punch, and sometimes you have to be able to throw a punch ‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì Nancy Pelosi‚Äôs modification of Theodore Roosevelt‚Äôs quote.

This is her story of how she decided to go into Congress and why she is still there, thirty-seven years later. And the topics within this valuable memoir not only her work, but also her private life‚Äôs experiences.  This review looks at 3 of the many power moves that were necessary for Ms. Pelosi to congruently express her fighting spirit on behalf of finding common ground on behalf of domestic and global needs.

For example, when Ms. Pelosi announced her candidacy for House Democratic whip, one of the male colleagues complained ‚ÄúWho said she could run?‚Äù  Other men explained to her that the other male representative had been waiting for the spot to open, and that by her running for that position, she was breaking the established order.  They also told her, ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just make a list of what you want to do, and we will do it for you?‚Äù  She responded with a ‚Äúno thanks,‚Äù followed by a description of the over two hundred years women have been waiting for that spot, and how that meant that she had been waiting longer than the other gentleman.  This powerful response was a great way to tell the men in the room, and the women colleague that she decides her path.

When she accepted the gavel, Ms. Pelosi was surrounded by her grandchildren and those of her colleagues, in the spirit of her commitment to be in Congress for the children.
Besides graciously and congruently telling her male colleagues that she decides when it is her turn, during the George W. Bush administration, Ms. Pelosi owned her voice when everyone told her that doing so would cost her career.

In 2002, President W. Bush had told everyone that Saddam Hussein was hiding weapons of mass destruction (WMD).  This was not long after the 9/11. Except, as this memoir described, before voting to go to war with Iraq, members of both chambers didn‚Äôt bother to verify whether or not the threat was real.  The intelligence community also hadn‚Äôt asked for a National Intelligence Estimate (NIE), which would be a report from sixteen intelligence agencies on whether or not there is a threat of war.

Ms. Pelosi told both chambers, ‚ÄúThe intelligence does not support the threat.‚Äù  Yet the American public were misled to believe that there was a threat; and Congress granted the president the power to use military force against the Iraqi government.  In the end, they learned, after over 100,000 Iraqi‚Äôs were killed, there were no WMDs.

Yet another of the many powerful examples captured in this memoir can be seen in how Congress, along with many outside groups, to include nuns, made sure that the Affordable Care Act passed.
When we consider that 62% of bankruptcies in the United States are caused by health care expenses, according to the ‚ÄúAmerican Journal of Medicine,‚Äù (2007), we have Ms. Pelosi to thank or doing something that presidents as far back as one hundred years did not accomplish.

Though everyone believed that Americans should have affordable healthcare, up to 2009, which was during the financial crisis, the Obama administration collaborated with Congress to create legislation to create the Affordable Care Act.  Prior to this, attempts to show Americans that health care is a right, not a privilege had been made through the execute branch, not Congress.

This time, it passed, but not without a great deal of stonewalling from the Republicans, priests, and from big insurance companies who had not realized how strong the public sentiment was to finally see that everyone in the United States could get affordable care.
Some its 2010 enactment, the ACA has been showing many impacts on America‚Äôs health and finances.
Here are some of them:
‚Ä¢ More than 40 million Americans have gained insurance;
‚Ä¢ Nearly 130 million Americans can no longer be denied health insurance because they have preexisting health conditions;
‚Ä¢ Women are no longer being charged up to 50% more than men;
‚Ä¢ Over 28 million jobs have been created in the Obama and Biden administrations since ACA was passed; and,
‚Ä¢ ACA is providing the biggest deficit reduction bill in decades, saving over $1 trillion.

Because this is such a powerful read, I was inspired by many new questions.

Here are some of them:
1. After the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, why did President George H.W. Bus allow Brent Scowcroft, his national security advisor, and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleberger travel to China to pledge that the United States would not let anyone come between China and the U.S.?  Is it because that administration put commercial interest above human rights abuses?  Also, are we as much at the China‚Äôs mercy now?
2. What repercussions, if any, had Secretary of the Treasure, Hank Paulson, experienced for his never having admitted the truth about the 2008 financial crisis, until Ms. Pelosi called him, and pressed for answers?
3.  If Bush was hoping that by covering up the financial crisis in 2006 ‚Äì 2007, long enough that he could blame the crisis on President Obama, what measures are in place to prevent a repeat of this?
4. Why had President Obama‚Äôs administration not told House Democrats that he placed a $900 billion cost limitation of the Affordable Care Act legislation?  If he told this to both chambers, how might the Republicans had used this against the Democrats?
5. If one of the main reasons Ms. Pelosi has stayed in Congress after the 2016 was to make sure that the ACA would survive, does this mean that if Kamala Harris becomes our next president, Ms. Pelosi will retire?

I recommend ‚ÄúThe Art of Power‚Äù to undergraduate students in:  political science; women‚Äôs studies; business communications; and, finance, because the details in this memoir walks readers through these topics on a level that I‚Äôve never seen before.

Still, this book is also written for those who are interested in what goes on in the federal government long before we hear about it in the media.  The details will give readers many ‚Äúah ha‚Äù moments.  There are also many hilarious details around her ‚Äúverbal judo‚Äù approaches towards resistant interlocutors.

153,R1UVLT08R8UMJN,Hayley Grace is an astonishing young writer,"""save me an orange"" by Hayley Grace stands as a remarkable testament to the talent of a young writer whose poetry resonates deeply with readers of all ages. Despite her youth, Hayley's words carry a wisdom and maturity that surpass her years, speaking directly to the hearts and souls of her audience.

What sets ""save me an orange"" apart is its rawness and honesty. She fearlessly delves into the complexities of life, laying bare her emotions and experiences with a passion that is palpable in every line. There's a refreshing lack of pretense in her writing; she doesn't sugarcoat the harsh realities nor does she exaggerate for effect. Instead, she presents her stories with authenticity, inviting readers to connect on a profound level.

One of the most compelling aspects of this collection is its universality. While Hayley's words may speak directly to the younger generation, their themes transcend age, speaking to the human condition in all its forms. Whether you're a teenager grappling with identity, an adult navigating the complexities of relationships, or someone trying to find their place in a tech-driven culture, there's something in these poems that will resonate with you.

Her poems are a testament to the power of poetry to illuminate the human experience.

Phoebe is depressed. Things are not going her way. She didn‚Äôt get tenure, she discovered she couldn‚Äôt biologically carry a baby, and now, is divorced from her husband who had an affair with one of their friends, a fellow academic. Phoebe decides that she‚Äôs going to commit suicide and she‚Äôs chosen a destination, an elegant inn in Newport, RI, a place she‚Äôs always wanted to go. Why not splurge. But when she gets there, an extravagant wedding is set to take place, and the entire wedding party is arriving. Everywhere she looks, wedding people. Enter the bride of all brides Lila whose recently deceased father left her a lot of money to celebrate her big day. Her peppy, all about me, I‚Äôm in love, getting married vibe contrasts with Phoebe‚Äôs sullen, I‚Äôve been dumped, I want to hide persona. Yet there is something similar about the two, that they don‚Äôt know about each other, a kindred spirit, and as Lila is drawn to Phoebe, finds out about her plans, she‚Äôs not having it.

181,R2RVOWHQ5OY9CZ,"especially wearing his adorable scrubs, is easy on the eyes and such ...","THE STORY:
Lisa: I went into this story completely blind. I do this quite a bit, honestly, and it almost always pays off. But with this book especially, I think going in blind is the way to go. If that‚Äôs not your reading style, I‚Äôll give you just a bit of background.

Lily hasn‚Äôt lived the easiest life. After graduating from college she moved to Boston where she opened her own business. Things were finally looking up for her. All of her hard work had paid off. She runs into a local neurosurgeon and immediately feels a connection with him. Ryle, especially wearing his adorable scrubs, is easy on the eyes and such a charmer. He‚Äôs also a player and only wants one-night-stands. He refuses to get into a relationship for several reasons, one of them being he just doesn‚Äôt have the time outside of being a doctor to be in a real relationship. The sparks start flying and Lily realizes she‚Äôs quite interested in Ryle‚Ä¶ that is, until a blast from her past, Atlas, reappears, and brings up allllll kinds of confusing feelings.

Becca: Yes! I 100% agree with Lisa, if you can go into this one blind then I recommend that you do! It was absolutely incredible to experience each moment and have no idea what was going to happen next!

I don‚Äôt want to say too much and spoil the story for anyone. I will say that this book does span a large part of Lily‚Äôs life. We see her as a teen and also as an adult, it was very well done and I enjoyed the blend of past and present.

THE CHARACTERS:
Becca: Oh these characters‚Ä¶ where do I begin?! I absolutely loved Lily! She had been through so much in her life, yet she persevered and followed her dreams. She was strong and fought for what she believed in. I loved learning about her past and being with her in the present. I felt as though I knew her, I understood and empathized with very thought and every emotion.

When Lily met Ryle, I fell for him as instantaneously as she did. He was strong, confident, funny and of course sexy in scrubs ;) Their relationship was a whirlwind that wrapped them up so quickly and I was in it with them! When things got tough for them, I felt every moment as harshly as they did.

When Atlas (the blast from Lily‚Äôs past) appears it throws this whole story in a different direction. Of course, we meet him with young Lily and then again later in the book. Atlas has this smooth, quiet confidence about him. He comes from absolutely nothing and makes something out of himself. I admired and respected him and I fell for him big time!

I know some of you are probably sniffing out a love triangle and freaking out. In my opinion, that is NOT what this is. Some may call it a love triangle on a technical basis, but it really is not and I urge you not to skip this one for that reason because that term is to cliched for what this book actually is.

Also the secondary characters in this book, Lily‚Äôs parents and Ryle‚Äôs sister and her husband are truly imperative in this story. They are just perfect and add so much to the story.

I do not think that there is another Author out there who can make me fall in love with characters quite so hard. CoHo develops her characters so well that I feel as though I know them! I had so many feels for these characters that my heart couldn‚Äôt handle it! In the past I have loved many CoHo characters (and I still do) but none made me feel what these characters did and none made me feel quite so much that I was a part of their story. Trust me when I say these are characters that you want to meet.

Lisa: That‚Äôs so, so true, Becca! I agree that CoHo has an amazing ability to make us fall in love with ALL characters, even the not-so-easy-to-love ones.

I‚Äôm honestly not sure I would categorize this as a love triangle. I know others have, but I disagree. (view spoiler)

My favorite characters in this story were, as Becca mentioned, the secondary characters. Specifically Ryle‚Äôs sister and her husband, who are wonderful additions to this beautiful story. I also enjoyed the family dynamics and how everyone had each others‚Äô backs when it was most important.

TO SUM UP:
Lisa: WOW! Just‚Ä¶ wow! This has got to be the BEST book Colleen Hoover has written to date. The stark honesty and impacting nature of this story will punch you in the feels. Hard. I‚Äôve never experienced an abuse story to quite this level. I was blown away by this story and left a babbling ball of nerves and tears. A book hasn‚Äôt touched me this deeply in quite some time. I also learned quite a bit from this story. We‚Äôre always so quick to judge in instances of abuse‚Ä¶ but there‚Äôs so much more to the story than you see with the naked eye. Don‚Äôt judge. Don‚Äôt assume facts that aren‚Äôt true. And, most importantly, don‚Äôt ever think it can‚Äôt happen to you or someone you know. Such a strong story that is sure to impact every reader that opens the cover in one way or another. I‚Äôm leave completely blown away by this story, as well as hopeful, which is such a wonderful thing. Colleen, you‚Äôve done it AGAIN!

Becca: I know some of you may think that I always say this and yes I am a true CoHo fan, but this is by far her best work ever. It Ends With Us is so raw and full of emotions, but most of all it is honest. I cried‚Ä¶ A LOT! And I am not talking a few tears or a quiet wimper‚Ä¶ I am talking ugly crying that I couldn‚Äôt contain. The message it delivers is a powerful one and I know that this is a book that will stay with me forever. Please make sure that once you are done you read the Author note at the end, it will give you an even better view of this book afterward.

Colleen Hoover, you slay me with your words. You break my heart and then put the pieces back together. You are an amazing writer and I believe you are a gift for readers like myself. Keep doing what you are doing and I will keep reading everything that you write.

184,R1DC45AZ5WS3PZ,Preventing your heart from forgiving someone you love is actually a hell of a lot harder than simply forgiving them.,"*Review originally posted on Goodreads*

'I wish cutting my feelings off for the person who hurt me was as easy as I used to think it would be. Preventing your heart from forgiving someone you love is actually a hell of a lot harder than simply forgiving them.'

It Ends With Us was beautifully complicated. It was hot and cold. Up and down. Good and bad. Beautiful and ugly... I'm still trying to figure out how I really feel about it all because I'm genuinely torn on how I want to perceive this storyline. I loved it but in all honesty, I really do think I hate it as well. Not the &quot;I-hate-you-Colleen-Hoover-stop-writing-books-and-find-a-different-career&quot; type of hate but rather &quot;I-hate-you-Colleen-Hoover-for-making-me-hate-everything-that-I-came-to-love&quot; kind of hate because it pretty much summarizes all my thoughts and feelings about It Ends With Us in one sentence.

My opinions were completely divided. One side of me, the hopeless romantic, was utterly unsatisfied and angry with the outcome of the story. The opposite side, the one that's all about women's empowerment, was cheering on #TeamLily like it was Independence Day.

Rather than trying to sugarcoat my thoughts, I'm just going to be completely honest. I was 100 percent team Ryle from the very first time we met him. Just like Lily, I fell in love with every word and every gesture that rolled off of his body. I. WAS. HOOKED. It also didn't help that I kept fantasizing Doctor Mike as Ryle Kincaid. *heart eyes emoji* I loved his ambition. His personality. His confidence. To be honest, I think I might've loved Ryle even more than Lily did but that's another story for another day. That more than likely explains why I took the second half of this book like a blow to the gut.

Once we got to the second half of the book, that's where it started going a bit downhill for me as a Ryle and Lily shipper. Every happy moment that ever happened between my ship came barreling down as it collided with pain and abuse. I was angry. I was thrashing. I was yelling at the pages in front of me, &quot;Why are you doing this Colleen?!&quot; But most importantly, I was just heartbroken to see such a beautiful couple become so toxic. Everything I loved about the first half of the book was slowly unraveling right before my very eyes as if it never really existed in the first place. I can't even remember how many times I wanted to put the book down because my hopeless romantic self just couldn't handle it anymore. But I just kept on reading because I was guiltily hoping that Ryle and Lily would still have their happy ending despite all that had happened. :/ Sadly, this was where I was torn the most.

I have the upmost respect for Lily. She is definitely one of my favorite female characters that Colleen has ever created because she did what a lot of us would've struggled to do in the end: walk away. Lily was such a strong character and I admire her so much for having the strength to stand up for herself. There were numerous times towards the end of the book where I knew I probably would've gave in and forgave Ryle for his actions but Lily was inflexible. She was in a tough position but she put her foot down and demanded better for herself. In the end, no matter if I ship Ryle/Lily or Atlas/Lily, I'm glad that Lily was able to find peace for her and Emmy.

As for Atlas, I liked him but I didn't love him. Definitely nowhere near my love for Ryle. I wasn't exactly rooting for Atlas but I wouldn't have minded if Lily chose him in the end. However, I still very much preferred Ryle regardless. I just felt that Atlas was the typical knight in shining armor. Typical good guy you run to. His background story was interesting but him as a character... not so much. He just felt so ordinary and predictable. I wanted to ship Atlas and Lily because let's face it, the signs were practically being shoved down our throats, and although the relationship between Ryle and Lily was developing, Atlas's presence was a like a thorn on your side you just couldn't shake off. But I just couldn't bring myself to ship them blindly like I did with Ryle and Lily.

Unfortunately, I was too far gone and too far in love with the idea of Ryle and Lily to make room for Atlas and because of that, I'm not sure if I'll ever be fully satisfied with that ending. I was happy that Lily was no longer a victim of domestic abuse. I'm glad that after all that happened between them, Lily and Ryle parted on good terms. I'll forever be heartbroken over the idea of what could've been. And I feel indifferent to Lily and Atlas. Sorry not sorry, Atlas. That basically sums up all my feelings in a nutshell.

To be honest, I was actually feeling a bit more bitter than I'm making it seem after that ending. But after reading the author's note, it really put things in perspective for me and made me look at the story with brand new eyes. I developed a new understanding and appreciation for the story behind the story.

I was dying for Ryle and Lily to have their happy ending. Until the very end, I was still rooting for them. It's such an ugly confession to make especially when the couple you're rooting for is toxic and abusive. And I think I feel this way because I never, and hopefully I never will, had to experience abuse. I don't know what it's like and what goes on in the minds of the abused. Colleen did such an excellent job at creating the perfectly imperfect man that was Ryle. Abuse in books has always been a trigger for me and if it were any other book I think I would've put this book down by the first incident of abuse. But Colleen just made you fall so deeply in love with a character that even you couldn't bring yourself to hate him even if you wanted to. YOU were the Lily of this story. But unfortunately, I don't think my Lily would've had the courage to leave. I really wish I could say that I would leave in an instant, but I think I would honestly be lying to myself. You can tell yourself that if you were in Lily's position you would leave in a blink of an eye, but things wouldn't be as easily said and done if you were the one who was actually experiencing it all. And in truth, I think this is exactly what Colleen wanted us to actually sit down and think about because victims who've experienced abuse wouldn't be rooting for Ryle and Lily. I wouldn't be rooting for Ryle and Lily. It just goes to show how much of a struggle it really is to walk away from someone you love and loves you back in all the wrong ways. I usually never read the author's notes after the book but I'm really glad I took the time to read Colleen's story. It really did make me see the situation from a different perspective.

I'd been having a bad CoHo streak for three books in a row (if you're curious, the books were ‚Äî in order ‚Äî Hopeless, November 9, and Too Late) and for a moment there I was beginning to think that I was doomed to never enjoy another book written by Colleen Hoover again. But PRAISE. It Ends With Us restored my faith completely in the CoHo hype. Not that I was ever planning NOT to read any more of Colleen's books! Colleen Hoover is 100 percent my favorite auto-buy author. I will always buy her books no matter if I end up loving them or not, and with good reason because Colleen is such an exceptional writer. It Ends With Us still wasn't able to top Ugly Love as my favorite CoHo book of all time but I really enjoyed this book more than I thought I would.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DC45AZ5WS3PZ,Mikee Andrea Quiambao,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71Sfu26+EaL._SY88.jpg'],,"Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2016",True,277 people found this helpful,B01GGU0XWC,,,

It's such an impactful and honest love story. That sometimes we fall in love with someone so deeply, only to find out they are a monster. And the reasons for why the cycle might continue. This book is about childhood love, falling in love in adulthood, abusive parental and domestic relationships, living out your dreams, finding forgiveness, and friendships.

This book tackled the subjects of domestic abuse and gaslighting so well, and especially how hard it is to face those kinds of challenges. I highly appreciate and admire that Colleen Hoover had the courage to get up and write this novel, despite it being very personal to her and was probably extremely emotional to write.

188,R1P6WI23J6P3YV,Everyone Needs to Read This Now!,"‚ÄúIn the future . . . if by some miracle you ever find yourself in the position to fall in love again . . . fall in love with me.‚Äù

I'm going to start this review off with this statement: I didn't cry while I was reading this book, but I did cry several days later when I was looking back on Lily's story. That shows how emotionally charged this story is, along with the true power behind Colleen's writing. I'm not going to give away any spoilers because you need to go into the book blind. If you want to know what happens, there are definitely some reviews out there that tell you the big twists and turns. But take my advice and don't spoil this book for yourself. It will lose a lot if you go in knowing exactly what to expect. So seriously, don't do it to yourself. Just let the beauty of Colleen's writing sweep over you and sink in.

‚ÄúAll humans make mistakes. What determines a person's character aren't the mistakes we make. It's how we take those mistakes and turn them into lessons rather than excuses.‚Äù

This is honestly not only one of the best reads of 2016, but also one of the most (if not the most) empowering. I want to give this book to every man, woman, and even teenager (it's definitely a NA/adult read) and tell them... READ THIS NOW! Do you want to know why? Because this book carries with it a very strong message, one that shows strength and courage that many people might not have at the time, but after reading will understand and gain. I honestly don't know if there has ever been a time when I was prouder to be reading the heroine's story due to her choices. Ultimately though, Colleen Hoover wrote a book that everyone can take something away from. Colleen always writes such unique stories, and this one is certainly no exception. But the one thing I will say is that this is truly her best book yet.

‚ÄúJust because someone hurts you doesn't mean you can simply stop loving them. It's not a person's actions that hurt the most. It's the love. If there was no love attached to the action, the pain would be a little easier to bear.‚Äù

Lily's story is one that I never wanted to stop reading. If I know that I'm going to need to read a book in multiple sittings (which was the case with this book), I usually try to find a good place to stop. One in which, nothing major is happening and nobody is facing some drastic/perilous moment. Well you see the problem with this book is the fact that there is literally NO. GOOD. STOPPING. POINT! None! There was never a part where I felt safe in letting this book sit overnight because I knew that the story and the what if's would play endlessly in my mind. So I stayed up and read it all in one sitting because I simply couldn't stop. Lily was someone that I connected to right from the get go. I knew as soon as the book started that I would like her, and that never once stopped while I was reading. However, I didn't realize how much her character would affect me while I was reading. As I said before, after I was finished reading, I couldn't have been prouder of her decisions. The strength she had throughout the story to go through what she did, but also her resolve and conviction just made me constantly cheer her on. Lily is truly one of the most admirable characters that I have ever had the pleasure of reading about, and that admiration goes extraordinarily deep.

‚ÄúLife is a funny thing. We only get so many years to live it, so we have to do everything we can to make sure those years are as full as they can be. We shouldn't waste time on things that might happen someday, or maybe even never.‚Äù

I mentioned it briefly above, but this book has a very powerful message, and this message is actually carefully woven into the story from page 1. You obviously don't realize it when you start reading the novel, but it's there when you look back after finishing. And this is also why I'm going to reiterate the importance of going into the story blind, because just as unexpected and emotional it is for the reader to read and witness what Lily goes through, it is even more unexpected and emotional for Lily. This is where this book truly shines, because you as a reader feel like part of the story. There's a very slow burn while reading, one in which we get to know characters and see the develop in the ways that we as humans get to know each other...but then Colleen rips that metaphorical rug out from under all of us, and shocks us with one revelation after another. But you know what? That's exactly how life is sometimes...sometimes you never see things coming in a million years and you have to figure out how to deal with these radical changes you never thought would happen.

‚ÄúIt stops here. With me and you. It ends with us.‚Äù

Where this book really got me though was the meaning of the title. Throughout the entire time I was reading, I kept wondering what the title meant. Because come on...this is Colleen Hoover and literally EVERYTHING has some significance (no matter how small). And when I got to the part of the story where the title finally made sense, guys let me tell you...this had an impact on me like no other. I just sat there with my book in my hands staring at the page for a solid 5 minutes. It is the perfect title for the perfect book.

‚ÄúFifteen seconds. That‚Äôs all it takes to completely change everything about a person. Fifteen seconds that we'll never get back.‚Äù

I connected with this book in my own way, and for that I am extraordinarily thankful to Colleen Hoover for even writing this book. The author's note at the end was just as powerful and amazing as the rest of the story, but it shows just how personal this story was for her to write. I applaud Colleen for writing this book and not &#34;making things easy&#34; for the main character or glossing over the &#34;bad parts.&#34; This is an incredibly realistic book that makes you realize many things and leaves an imprint on your soul. It's important to remember that everyone must make extraordinarily difficult decisions in their life, and not everyone will agree with them. If this book even empowers one woman to take steps in making an important decision, the Colleen Hoover did her job. And I count myself lucky to have had the honor of reading this story because I am a changed person because of it!

Happy reading :)",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1P6WI23J6P3YV,Amazon Customer,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on August 30, 2016",True,971 people found this helpful,B01GGU0XWC,,,

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I want to start by saying that for some reason these books are classified as romances in some places, but I personally do not agree with that. I think these fit more as contemporary fiction/women‚Äôs fiction with a romantic storyline. I also think that if you go into reading these with the expectation of them not being romances, you‚Äôll like them more.

There were things I liked about these, and things I disliked. The way they are written really make you feel for Lily and emphasize with the situation she is in. It really showcases how your entire life can become intertwined with someone, which makes removing them from your life difficult. It was a little disappointing to not see her ‚Äúfound family‚Äù step in and intervene a little more though.

There were a couple interactions between Lily and her other friends that seemed weirdly unrealistic (she mentions Devon and her ‚Äúweren‚Äôt really friends‚Äù but they‚Äôre comfortable enough that he can just reach into her dress and fix her bra? Like bruh). Also, Ryle blowing up a photo of Lily and hanging it in his sister‚Äôs apartment is such a weird red flag üö©üö©

Also, I have a love/hate relationship with using diary entries to explain someone‚Äôs past. Sometimes it can feel a bit lazy/boring (which, in this case, it did).

It Starts With Us was pretty average. I was interested in seeing what happened between Lily and Atlas but overall the book fell a little flat for me. There wasn‚Äôt anything wrong with it, it just felt slow to me. I did enjoy seeing the relationship between Atlas and his brother form though.

Overall, if you view these as contemporary fiction (which I did), they‚Äôre an okay read. Definitely check online for the TWs/CWs before starting.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JLBQ8PRTD50E,@razzle.reads,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/81578f09-df61-40e4-9573-9f924f191e64._CR0,0,500,500_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2024",True,,B01GGU0XWC,,,
190,R3LN8CV7G2GZQG,Great read - don‚Äôt really like lily that much.,"SPOILER ALERT

Lily was slightly annoying to my husband and I.  This book sounds like it‚Äôs written from a young women‚Äôs perspective, however I believe this is the authors real mindset.  She withheld a bunch of information from Ryle.  A lot of her actions during their relationship would‚Äôve irritated me in real life.  Which brings me to say that I can understand Ryle reacting towards the information he found out.  I don‚Äôt condone DV under any circumstances and I‚Äôm glad lily got of the situation but ughhhh.  He was also pushed to his limits in my opinion.  I don‚Äôt like the young female mindset of being able to do whatever we want and then not reaping the consequences of it.  I don‚Äôt like that she blames their divorce solely on Ryle when she played a part.  Reading the epilogue has me kind of not wanting to read anymore of Colleen‚Äôs books.  Personally, I found it absolutely disrespectful to not allow your father to walk you down the aisle.  I thought your mom left him so you could have a better impression of your father yet you still decided to allow another man walk you down the aisle. However, personal feelings aside - it was a very good read.

But  there is so much in this work that needs to be understood by men;  women's historical oppression, their role as subjects and  for many women, the abject fear associated with childbirth.
Moreover the books creative narrative of comparing contemporary New York with Elizabethan England improves what Picoult wants us to understand.

My breath was taken away in many parts of this book, especially reading Emelia's POV when allusions to Shakespearean plays were woven in and lines from many of his poems/plays were interspersed among various points in her life in particular. One, which I won't say what happened, but she went through a horrible tragedy and the lines from Shakespeare were woven in so beautifully and artistically that it brought me to tears.

Many of Shakespeare's plays/poems were alluded to and the one I recognized the most of was Romeo and Juliet, because I taught it for 25 years. And because I was most familiar with that particular Shakespearean work, I loved seeing parts of it alluded to and being able to recognize parts that I'm sure others wouldn't.

194,RQN8T9TJK3WRM,Shakespeare and Company,"Back in my colleges days, I wondered about William Shakespeare: why is it that such a learned storyteller and a fella who must have been familiar with Elizabeth‚Äôs court did not leave a library to his beneficiaries.  Though his son had died, he had a living daughter (I think).  And then there was this thought‚Äîthat Shakespeare was a pen name, as in ‚Äúto shake a spear‚Äù at some person, some concept, some event.  I discussed this once with my daughter (who had performed in several Shakespeare plays in college and after) and she just said, ‚ÄúWell, it doesn‚Äôt really matter.  It‚Äôs the work that endures and that is what is important.‚Äù
But the historian in me, remembering when I could not get a credit card in my own name without a struggle and tense negotiation with a banker, and being aware of the need for unions for women mill workers, the Triangle factory fire, and even Ruth Bader Ginsberg, I think my generation of women may wonder at the notion of the major thing‚Äî-that the work endures.  Nowadays we take women inventors and writers more seriously.  Is the longevity of the work more important than the identity of the creator?  Nowadays we have patents and something called plagiarism.
So when Jodi Picoult pens this historical novel about Elizabethan ancestor Emilia Bassano, I‚Äôm in.  Emilia, a young mistress of Lord Chamberlain, is both lovely and learned, and when he dies (or is with his less valued but legal wife), Emilia is left with little and struggles with an abusive and worthless husband.  She has a baby but aborts another, finds herself madly in love with Southampton, and in an even more unlikely role of a gifted storyteller at a time when women could not appear on the stage and were even less welcomed as authors.  She sells some stories (As You Like It, Romeo and Juliet, Titus Andronicus) to actor William Shakespeare who gets them produced.
Emilia‚Äôs struggle is countered with modern writer Melina Green, a gifted storyteller whose work is dismissed by a theatre critic when she is a student at Bard.  Somewhat traumatized by the critic‚Äôs scathing review of her work, Melina‚Äôs work is entered into a competition in which her gay  male roommate‚Äîa person of color‚Äî-assumes her identity as ‚ÄúMel‚Äù Green.
Aye, and there‚Äôs the rub.
It‚Äôs a great romp-read with queries to take to heart: maybe don‚Äôt allow outside evaluation to cause you to abandon work you love, value your ancestry and research it understanding that some of your talent ‚Äî-such as linguistic intelligence‚Äî-might just be on a gene which is relentless, and take control of your reproductive freedom to fit your life circumstances.
And just be open to thinking that at least some of Shakespeare‚Äôs work might have been penned by a woman.  It would not be the first time a man took credit for a woman‚Äôs work.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQN8T9TJK3WRM,suzy hallock-bannigan,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2024",True,,B0CT69D7NF,,,

196,R1NGT7GIVYR367,Good Book,"Having been a Literature major in college and familiar with Shakespeare and his cohorts, I was surprised (and pleased) to learn that one of the Bard‚Äôs alleged collaborators was a woman named Emilia Bassano.  This is her story, as well as that of Melina Greene, a fictional present-day ancestor.  As a struggling playwright, Melina is convinced that the theater community is prejudiced against women, but 10 years out of college, she discovers Emilia and writes a play about her.  Melina‚Äôs roommate Andre submits the play to a festival without her knowledge and under a male pseudonym.  The play is accepted with accolades, creating a situation neither of them had foreseen.  In another era, Emilia lives an unexpected life, first sold by her family as a mistress to the Lord Chamberlain and later forcibly married to the husband nobody wanted (especially Emilia).  She becomes acquainted with the theater community through the Lord Chamberlain and begins to write poetry.  She also falls in love with the young Earl of Southampton and begins an affair that shapes the rest of her life.  Eventually, she writes plays, which she sells to William Shakespeare in order to keep her married home solvent.  This is a book that is steeped in the language of Shakespeare‚Äôs plays; lines of dialogue appear both as quotes and as words spoken by the characters.  The author challenges the reader to pick them out and provides an index at the end.  While it seems that someone who studied Elizabethan literature might get more out of the book, this isn‚Äôt necessarily so, as Melina‚Äôs story is completely contemporary and draws parallels between present and past.

I respect and admire Piccoult's careful research and her building an actual case for her heroine. Her storyline was much the stronger of the two.
On the other hand, I wish Piccoult spent as much time on her writing as she did on her research. I am continally disheartened by weak writing.

198,R41HV9G059GS3,History repeats itself,"Told in dual timelines, By Any Other Name was a winner for me.  I enjoy historical fiction, or possibly fact, and although I'm not a fan of dual timelines, this one worked.  Emilia Bassano and Melina Green have different dress, customs, and lifestyles, but essentially are fighting the same fight women have for millennium.  Their skills are not being taken seriously or their skills are co-opted by the men in their lives.

Emilia must sell her plays to Shakespeare so they will be produced.  Melina has her play submitted under a male pseudonym, since the person approving the play does not like women playwrights.  Using the dual timeline, we can see very clearly that not much has changed!

You can tell there was a huge amount of time and effort put forth doing research about Bassano.  She is in the running for the playwright for Shakespeare or at least one of a few.  With Ms. Picoult's recent Broadway play, she has inside information on what goes on in NYC!

Jodi Picoult picks difficult and thought provoking themes for her stories.

But @jodipicoult has convinced me! The idea that a woman was one of the group of writers whose work Shakespeare put his name on just makes sense. And I love how the book draws modern parallels about female playwrights of today that struggle to have their plays produced.

The historical character, Emilia Bassano was fascinating. I love how the author brought her story to life from the pages of history. Her survivors spirit carried her through the many twists that life threw at her. And her strength and resilience made me root for her.

I enjoyed the modern story, too. A bit of a romance. A bit of a comedy of errors worthy of Shakespeare himself Emilia herself. False names. Secret identities. And a woman struggling to fight against sexism while also recognizing her own privilege.

And the Shakespeare buffs will appreciate all the references scattered throughout along with actual quotes.

201,R3HQC2V3HW32ZV,"This is not ""new age"" self help book! This book is based on modern linguistic theory and philosophical precepts.","I should start off by stating my background. I am an undergrad student of philosophy and linguistics, a branch of the humanities. I also deeply love this series of books because of its obviousness and simplicity. It has personally helped me triumph over many, many challenges. This is why I decided to write a review here.

There is a huge tradition of skepticism in linguistics, especially about how language is used in various cultures to create belief systems. A belief system is basically a set of instructions inside your brain based on language. These instructions help you navigate the stressful world around you so you can survive. We are psychologically wired to think our belief systems are accurate and experience deep stress if we find them to be inaccurate.

The trouble is, our belief systems are ALWAYS inaccurate. Yes, I used the word &#34;always&#34; for a reason.

Without going deeply into the study of philosophy and linguistics, I will give you an overview here:

Philosophy - When you study philosophy, you study belief systems about how the world works and explore important questions like &#34;is there a God?&#34; or &#34;What is consciousness.&#34; You may not be surprised to find out that philosophy majors have not come up with answers to these questions because there is always a case where we are going to be wrong or have a counter argument. Much of the study of philosophy is the collection of vocabulary words to describe beliefs. They even have a mathematical component called propositional logic, where one takes sentences and reduces them to symbols and creates &#34;proofs&#34; but even prop-logic is under fire from academics for its complete inability to predict anything. In other words, it isn't the answer either.

Linguistics - When you study words and language, you realize that all our beliefs are based on language and this language can never &#34;touch reality&#34; in that language is just an arbitrary description of reality, posing as real. I believe Miguel Ruiz must have taken a linguistics course as well--as his first agreement attests to the power of language. The four agreements pulls heavily from Saussure and Derrida. Both Saussure and Derrida (and many, many others) did work on how we form ideas in our heads based on language. The gist is this: we have something called a &#34;symbol&#34; in our brain which is composed of two parts: the word and the visual representation of the object (look up semiotics for further detail). These symbols are in our mind and work together to form meaning, then belief. The unfortunate thing is that they are entirely made up. It isn't real. Our ideas of it aren't real.

If you really want a deeper understanding on how linguistics has saturated our belief systems I recommend reading some of their academic essays or get Rivkin and Ryan's literary theory books. They are excellent and will take you further down the rabbit hole. Most of the essays are dense but worth the effort!

To simplify: scientists and academics in the millions have tried and tried and tried to find &#34;the true belief&#34; for thousands, maybe tens of thousands of years and we have not yet arrived at any truth. Because of domestication, we think other people have it, but they don't! &#34;Truth&#34; is defined as that which has the most predictive power. So far, mathematics, geometry, and physics has the most predictive power. Our belief systems simply do not.

So any beliefs about yourself can be true and they can also be false. We can't know. So why not pick something positive? If no one knows anything, then how can you even know anything?

But you don't need to study this yourself. All you have to do is think back to your past self, let's say ten years ago. Did that person have a belief system that you now consider to be faulty? How is that possible? What about your future self? Will that person believe you have a faulty belief system? Probably! How is this possible? How can you be SO WRONG? Is it because you &#34;haven't learned?&#34; I highly doubt it!

But we have to be right! We ARE RIGHT! At least we think we might be . . . maybe?

The need to be right is so ingrained within us that we create a huge drama when someone contradicts our beliefs. We end relationships over it! We storm out! We write angry twitter updates.

HOW THIS BOOK HAS PERSONALLY HELPED ME:

- No one person's opinion will ever again have the power to limit what I can do, even if this person is an authority figure
- No one group's opinion will ever again have the power to limit what I can do
- No one has a clear idea of who or what I am, not even me!
- When people talk, they are telling stories. I don't have to argue. I don't have to fight. I simply have to listen. WOW!
- I cannot comprehend another person's dream. I can't mind read. I can't assume. I know nothing of their inner workings.
- Even scary, aggressive people are just telling stories.
- I no longer have to feel ashamed about who I am or what I've done or where I'm going. It's not my job to assign a story to my life, or a judgment.
- I no longer have to pretend to be something or hustle to gain love. I just need to love who is willing to love back. It's so simple.
- I take all gurus, religions, indictments and gossip with quite a high level of benevolent skepticism, which allows me to be free from the fear that goes along with these stories.
- I don't take myself as seriously as I used to.

Probably the most valuable of all . . .

- I have a deep compassion for all people. We are all just stuck here together, trying our hardest and doing our best. I don't have to hate someone because their best wasn't up to some story I tell myself. I don't' have to insist they believe in my story.

 1. Be Impeccable with Your Word: Ruiz emphasizes the power of words and how they shape our reality. This agreement encourages honesty, integrity, and positivity in our speech, helping us to build trust and create a positive impact on ourselves and others.
 2. Don‚Äôt Take Anything Personally: This agreement teaches us to let go of the need for approval and not to be affected by others‚Äô opinions or actions. Understanding that others‚Äô behaviors are a reflection of their own reality, not ours, allows us to maintain inner peace and self-confidence.
 3. Don‚Äôt Make Assumptions: By avoiding assumptions and seeking clarity, we can prevent misunderstandings and unnecessary suffering. This agreement promotes open communication and the courage to ask questions and express our true feelings.
 4. Always Do Your Best: Recognizing that our best effort may vary from moment to moment, this agreement encourages us to strive for personal excellence without self-judgment. Doing our best in every situation helps us live without regrets and fosters self-acceptance.

Ruiz‚Äôs writing is clear and accessible, making profound concepts easy to understand and apply. The practical advice is complemented by insights into the human condition and the ways in which societal conditioning can limit our potential.

Published in 1997, the book has sold over 8 million copies worldwide and has been translated into 48 languages.

The book draws inspiration from the wisdom of the Toltec tradition, an ancient Mesoamerican culture. Ruiz presents four agreements that he believes can lead to inner peace, happiness, and success.

The Four Agreements

1. Be Impeccable with Your Word:
This means speaking with integrity and honesty. Avoid gossip, criticism, and negativity. Use your words to uplift, inspire, and create harmony.

2. Don't Take Anything Personally:
Realize that others' actions and words are not about you. They are a reflection of their own perceptions and beliefs. Don't let their opinions define you or make you feel less worthy.

3. Don't Make Assumptions:
Communicate clearly and ask questions when necessary. Assumptions can lead to misunderstandings and unnecessary hurt. Trust in clear communication to avoid confusion.

4. Always Do Your Best:
Strive to give your best in every situation, regardless of the outcome. By doing your best, you will gain self-respect and fulfillment, even if the results are not always perfect.

Practical Implications

Applying these agreements can have profound effects on our daily lives. By being impeccable with our words, we create a positive and supportive environment. When we avoid taking things personally, we liberate ourselves from the weight of others' judgments and opinions. Not making assumptions allows us to maintain clear and harmonious relationships. And by always doing our best, we tap into our potential and build a strong foundation for personal growth.

Path to Personal Freedom

Ruiz believes that by adopting these four agreements, we can break free from the limitations imposed by our own minds and the expectations of others. We can create a life of authenticity, acceptance, and joy.

Conclusion

'The Four Agreements' is a timeless guide to personal freedom. Ruiz's wisdom is accessible and applicable to people from all backgrounds and walks of life. By embracing these simple yet profound agreements, we can transform our relationships, our self-perception, and ultimately, our lives. By choosing to live in harmony with these agreements, we open ourselves to a world of possibilities and personal fulfillment.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YFB0C4PZT76S,Susan,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/bfab73c9-d20a-442b-99ec-436e3daa072b._CR54,0,392,392_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2024",True,38 people found this helpful,1878424319,,,

205,R1WW6N65E9D8WW,Become a Better You,"What can we do to improve ourselves as humans? There are thousands of recipes for self- improvement and no end to the number of books written on the subject. One book that is simpler and easier to understand that others is The Four Agreements, a philosophical/self- help book that aims to make you a better person.

Based on ancient Toltec wisdom, this book outlines four broad, simple goals that will help each one of us gain more freedom over our lives and improve as people. The four truths are: Being impeccable with your word; not taking things personally; not making assumptions; and always doing your best. The first one, about being true/impeccable to your words, forms the groundwork for the other truths.

This book‚Äôs greatest strength is its simplicity. It doesn‚Äôt get bogged down in philosophical lingo and this fact makes it a good choice for those who appreciate philosophy, but who get tired of philosophical books that require a bachelor‚Äôs degree and access to a dictionary to understand. The book is a quick read and the way it is written, anyone can directly grasp its key points.

The Four Agreements and its advice are things that have been said in one form or another by other philosophy books and/or self- help books. The message can get a little repetitive as you read, but I didn‚Äôt mind because I feel like this is the type of general advice that needs to be drilled into your head. The more you hear it, the more it will hopefully ring true and the more likely you will be to take action.

I read this book in a single sitting, while I was on an airplane flying home from vacation. I agreed with and liked what I read and immediately started to think about my own life and how well I am living up to these four agreements. I would rate myself around eighty; meaning, I feel that I am following these words of wisdom about 80 percent of the time. There is still room for improvement, but I feel like I am ahead of most people.

If I had any issue with this book, it is that it does tend to speak in absolutist terms more than I would prefer. It seems to think that everyone is going to be better off and see improvement if they follow this advice, no exceptions. This, of course, is not the case. Will most humans improve their lives and freedom if they follow what this book says? Yes, absolutely. But there will always be exceptions to the rule.

Self- improvement is a huge industry and books like The Four Agreements are useful for those who want to live a better, happier, more fulfilling life and need general guidance to reach their goals. This book is about as straightforward as you can get and the ease of reading and no- nonsense approach is just what humanity needs to work out our problems and be all we can be.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1WW6N65E9D8WW,Bryan Carey,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/d8a6ae77-9194-455f-ba43-fd90b1494a77._CR0,0,425,425_SX48_.jpg",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61GEy6PUNbL._SY88.jpg'],,"Reviewed in the United States on December 22, 2022",True,48 people found this helpful,1878424319,,,

209,R2OHOSSYMDIKDF,A Trip Into Mysticism,"The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz

 &

 The Fifth Agreement by Don Miguel Ruiz and Don Jose Ruiz

 I decided to ‚Äúreview‚Äù or ‚Äúsummarize‚Äù these books together because the Fifth Agreement is very much a continuation of the first book, and in fact reiterates much of the earlier text. Both are based on the philosophy of the Toltec, ancient people of southern Mexico who were known as women and men of knowledge.

 Before delving into the books, I should acknowledge that I found then somewhat difficult. Although I have read a great many of what I would call ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù books and wrings in the recent years, these readings, although similar, were a bit more difficult to fully digest.  The author at times anticipates such problems on the part of the reader, and is indeed accurate in that regard.

 The Toltecs were not a race or tribe, or nation, but scientists and artists formed to explore and conserve the spiritual knowledge and practices of the ‚Äúancient ones‚Äù. They came together as masters (naguals) and students at Teotihuacan, the ancient city of pyramids outside Mexico City and known as the place where ‚ÄúMan Becomes God‚Äù.  The Toltec recognize that some 3000 years ago a human studying to be a medicine man woke to the realization that everything is made of light and that all that exists is one living being, and that light is the messenger of life because it is alive and contains all information. He called the stars the tonal and the light between the stars the nagual, and knew what created the harmony between the two is life or intent.  He saw himself in everything- in every human, every animal, every tree, in the water, the clouds and the earth.  As I read the book, this seeing, this realization, is the truth, is pure love and pure light. It is this truth that we much search for. But why must we search if such truth is everywhere?

 We must search because we have lost the truth. When we are born devoid of language, we are the truth‚Äìour presence is a miracle. We feel and see what is, without interpretation or judgment. But, as we grow, we are what the author calls ‚Äúdomesticated‚Äù, just as animals are. The truth that we feel is replaced by symbols-words- that are mere illusions, that are opinions grafted onto objects and feelings. We apply our attention‚Äì the ability to discriminate and focus only on what we want to perceive- on these symbols. As children we believe what adults say, especially our parents, and our world becomes a dream, a reality built on symbols from others, not the silent feelings and observations that we experienced as infants.  And this learned reality-our dream- tells us how to behave in society; what to believe and not believe; what is acceptable and not acceptable; what is good and bad; right and wrong; beautiful and ugly. We are imperfect because we do not measure up to an image of perfection that has been imposed on us by others.  And we accept such law and structure by a system of reward for doing what is ‚Äúright‚Äù and punishment for doing what is ‚Äúwrong‚Äù.  This acceptance reflects a multitude of agreements we have made with our world.  We are judged and punished and then punish ourselves for bad behavior. We become victims who carry guilt for such failures, and are punished again and again whenever we are reminded, or remind ourselves of such failures. We live in a dream ruled by fear and filled with emotions of anger, jealousy, envy and hate. We must be right and prove others wrong. Our mind and our world become a fog‚Äìa mitote- a dream where a thousand people talk at once and no one understands. The author feels that, as a result, we are living in a dream of hell. We then search for the truth, for a way out of this hell.  And yet, the truth is already within us, we don‚Äôt have to search, we just have to uncover what is part of us already, as it was when we were born.

 To escape our dream of hell, we must break the old agreements that are fear based and reclaim our personal power. We must create a new dream, our own dream- our personal dream of heaven. The author suggests four basic agreements that you must make with yourself to reclaim your own power and find a heaven on earth, a life of joy and fulfillment.

  The First Agreement- Be Impeccable With Your Word.
 The author feels that this first agreement is the most important and powerful. I noticed a few things about the wording. First, he uses the singular ‚Äúword‚Äù, rather than ‚Äúwords‚Äù.  I think perhaps this is in deference to the use of such term in the bible where John, speaking of creation, says ‚ÄúIn the beginning was the word, and the word was God, and the word is God.‚Äù Through words you express your creative power. But he obviously means the plural, that your use of language must be impeccable.  The use of ‚Äúimpeccable‚Äù is also interesting. Our common definition of ‚Äúimpeccable‚Äù is faultless or flawless. But it also means incapable of sin or without sin. It is this meaning that the author employs. He feels that a sin is anything that goes against yourself, and being impeccable is not gong against yourself, taking responsibility for your actions, but not judging or blaming.  He says that if one loves him or her self, then he or she will express that love in interaction with others, and will thus be impeccable with the word, because such word, such action, will produce a like reaction. He contrasts words coming from love with those coming from what he calls black magic. He feels that gossip is the worst form of black magic, for it is judgmental language about others, even those we do not know. It is emotional poison that we teach to our children and friends and loved ones through our use of such criticism.  The word is too often used to blame, to criticize, to find guilt and destroy. He gives the simple example of a child being told by her mother to shut up her singing because her voice was ‚Äúugly‚Äù. The child obviously agreed with her mother, and thus made an agreement with herself not to sing any more. These are the type of agreements that we make in life that are harmful and destructive, that lead us into our dream of hell.  Instead, when you are impeccable with your words, they are no longer fertile ground for gossip and criticism, but for love.  And as you use such words, first by expressing love for yourself, you break all the many agreements that make you suffer, and begin to build your own dream of heaven on earth.

 I don‚Äôt read ‚Äúimpeccable‚Äù to mean absolutely honest, for there are times when being absolutely honest could be counter to your words coming from love.

 The Second Agreement- Don‚Äôt Take Anything Personally.

 This is much easier said than done and I also think that the author assumes that one is practicing impeccability in their word before adopting this. He basically feels that people take things personally because we assume that things said are truly about us and that we are prone to believe them. In fact, he feels that people do not do or say things because of us, but because of themselves. Also, whatever they do or say is a product of their own belief system, of their own personal dream. Thus, what they may think about me is not about me but is about them. Instead of accepting this, we resort to the need to be right, and show the other wrong, so we magnify the power of their words or deeds.

 If instead we always act from a sense of love‚Äìthe impeccability of our word- then if someone is mad at me, then I know that he or she is mad at him or herself and I am just the excuse for their anger. When you stop taking things personally you can keep your heart open and not be harmed. You will not need to trust in what others do or say, but only trust yourself to make responsible choices.  And you must remember that neither praise nor criticism is to be taken personally because it is not about you, but the speaker.

 As I said at the outset of my comments on this Agreement, I think, in discussing this Agreement, that the author assumes that he is impeccable with his word. If not, then how could he say that when someone gets mad at you they are mad at themselves? This may still be true even if you were not using your word impeccably, but it would be harder to accept, especially since, in his discussion of impeccability, the author says that one must take responsibility for his actions. Wouldn‚Äôt this mean that when we are less than impeccable that we must accept some consequence, but not punish our self endlessly?  Couldn‚Äôt someone‚Äôs anger be about us if our word was less than impeccable, but instead filled with the black magic mentioned by the author?  I raise these questions in my mind because at times, as I read through this, it sounds as if one can ‚Äúget a pass‚Äù for less than sterling behavior because he need not take others reactions personally. I don‚Äôt think this is the author‚Äôs message, but it could be read into some of the philosophy.

 The Third Agreement- Don‚Äôt Make Assumptions

 The author starts off his discussion with this statement:

 ‚ÄúAll the sadness and drama you have lived in your life was rooted in making assumptions and taking things personally.‚Äù

Although I would question the use of the word ‚Äúall‚Äù (I have a hard time with such broad statements like ‚Äúall‚Äù or ‚Äúnone‚Äù or‚Äúalways‚Äù or ‚Äúnever‚Äù), I basically agree with his statement, especially as it concerns emotional reaction to others.  (True sadness from the passing of a child or similar ‚Äúobjective‚Äù tragedy is hard to relate to assumptions or taking things personally) I have found that people often assume my meaning, and sometimes take offense at something that was never intended to harm. They probably misunderstood, but, as the author notes, were afraid to ask for clarification and therefore filled in any uncertainty with an assumption.  I don‚Äôt know exactly why we are afraid to ask for clarification, maybe it roots back to those days when we were reluctant to ask questions in school. Maybe it a fear of being wrong, even if it is a subjective response to another.  I don‚Äôt know why we do such things, but know that we do, and that it causes great and unnecessary pain.

 I think these two agreements about taking things personally and making assumptions are really part of a self centeredness that ‚Äúit is all about me‚Äù.  We often tell people, ‚Äòit‚Äôs not always about you‚Äù , but such words are almost in jest. In fact it is really important to realize that it isn‚Äôt always about you, especially when the assumptions made generally do assume so and lead to taking things personally.  Not making assumptions would seem to be one of the easier agreements to live up to, as it only involves a little bit of inquiry. But, like any change, it requires practice. The author just suggests that you

 ‚ÄúMake sure the communication is clear. If you don‚Äôt understand, ask. Have the courage to ask questions until you are clear as you can be, and even then do not assume that you know all there is to know about a given situation.‚Äù

Good advice.

 The Fourth Agreement is About the Action of the First Three- Always do Your Best.

 The author stresses always doing your best, but knowing that your best will vary from one moment to the next depending on how you feel, etc. But, whatever your state, you must always do your best‚Äìneither less nor more. Trying to do more than your best will cause you to spend unneeded energy and, in the end, your best will not be good enough. You must be motivated to do your best not by some expected reward, but by the love of what you are doing. Doing your best will help with the other three agreements and it will also make you feel better even if you suffer failures in the other three. If you keep trying to do your best you will become a master of transformation-practice will make you the master.  Always doing your best requires a great deal of effort. If you break an agreement, then you must be willing to begin again the next day and try your best to keep such agreement.

 In reading the author‚Äôs comments on this fourth agreement I am unsure whether he is relating ‚Äúdoing your best‚Äù to life in general or to the application of the other three agreements. I see his book as being primarily focused on reaching an internal contentment and happiness, not on navigating one‚Äôs way through the world at large.  Admittedly, such inner contentment may well supply the path to successfully living in this rather complex world. I just find a bit of a contrast between the focus of this work and something like ‚ÄúFalling Upward‚Äù by Richard Rohr where he acknowledges the need to survive in the competitive world as a means of gaining some level of confidence before, in the second half of life, we are able to discard much of the baggage of the first half and seek out a more personal and spiritual contentment.  Of course, this may be my misreading of both books, but, that‚Äôs what an opinion is all about. I also see a basic similarity between the two, and among other spiritual pieces that I have read. All see Western culture as imposing and espousing a very competitive, win/loose guilt ridden mentality. Such mentality may or may not be necessary for the struggles that we face, but, all my readings  seem to agree that at some point our thoughts need to focus on attaining a more peaceful and inclusive level of spiritual contentment.  This is the truth that the Four Agreements challenge you to seek.

 The Fifth Agreement - Be Skeptical but Learn to Listen

 As the author has pointed out, we learn from symbols, and these symbols do not represent the truth, which is present in everything. Symbols are people‚Äôs interpretations of objects and feelings and are not the truth, but are often lies. Thus, it is important to be skeptical, but he adds that you must then listen. When you listen carefully to others you can then understand the symbols that they are using and understand their story‚Äìtheir dream. Your communication improves and you can then see if what another is saying has relevance to you. You do not have to believe their story, for it is only symbols. Similarly, you do not have to believe your own story, for it is just made from your symbols. Neither story is the truth, the truth simply is, whether you believe in it or not. It doesn‚Äôt need you to believe, for it simply is.

 When you listen you don‚Äôt have to form or express opinions, you merely need to listen. By merely listening you show respect for the other person‚Äôs dream, for the reality he or she has created. The author sees all persons essentially as artists who create their worlds, and they must be respected as such. When we listen and share our stories, we try to understand them and make them part or our stories if we so desire‚Äìor not. If you gain control over your symbols then what is left is the real you, and the real you, not your symbols, makes your choices.

 In trying to summarize what the author is saying I find myself struggling at times to get to the crux of his message.  I think that perhaps by expanding his work to this Fifth Agreement he intends to open the door to spread the wisdom of the Four Agreements to others.  The first Four Agreements taught us that out symbols are not the truth, and that many of these symbols‚Äìour entire symbology as he calls it- are lies that lead us to blame and shame and guilt, to a living hell. The Four Agreements help us escape this personal hell, but perhaps there is more that we need to do.

 The author expands his discussion to outline the different stages that we go through as we try to reach our heaven on earth. He calls these steps ‚Äúattentions‚Äù. The first Attention is the dream we create when we first use our attention to absorb the various symbols that we learn, and we then believe such symbols represent knowledge and our reality. He calls this first attention the ordinary dream of humans or the dream of the victims. It is a dream of victims because we are the victims of the false symbols which form our reality. And our reality is not about us, it is a mirror reflecting what others expect of us and for us. You must be freed of such reality and discover your true self.

 Then we reach a stage where we realize that our dream is a lie and we use the attention a second time to try to change our dream and create a new one.  This is the Second Dream of Attention or the Dream of the Warriors because we now declare war against all the lies in our knowledge.  It is a war against that part of our mind that makes all the choices that guide us into our personal hell. It‚Äôs a war between out true self and our belief system‚Äìwhat the author calls the tyrant or the big judge.  In this battle we fight to throw off the belief system that causes us to repeatedly punish ourselves for past ‚Äúwrongs‚Äù- the system that brings up past thoughts and punishes us over and over again. The author notes that

 ‚ÄúHumans are the only animals on earth who punish themselves a thousand times or more  for the same mistake, and who punish everybody else a thousand times or more for the same mistake.‚Äù

He instead postulates that true justice is to pay once for every mistake.  As a warrior, one fights to find his true self.

 The author then notes that the dream of the second attention ends when something very important happens, something called the last judgment. This is the last time that we judge ourselves or anyone else. It‚Äôs the day we accept ourselves just the way we are and everyone else just the way they are.  When the day of our last judgment comes, the war in our head is over and the dream of the third attention begins. We move from the dream of the warriors to the dream of the masters. This is a dream of truth and respect and joy. It is that point where we come back to our real state, our divine self, where we fell a communion of love with everything in existence.  When we learn that the symbols are not the truth, then we are left to simply enjoy life, as we did before the symbols ruled us. We experience what he refers to as a resurrection, and it allows us to be wild and free like a child, except that we have freedom with wisdom instead of innocence. At this point we don‚Äôt need to judge ourselves or others, we don‚Äôt need to be right, nor prove others wrong, and we can express love with no shame or justification and walk in the world with our heart completely open. This is the goal‚Äì a life of joy.

 These books express a philosophy couched in rather mystical terms‚Äìin dreams and symbols, attention and awareness. But its message seems quite similar to other philosophies and much that is discussed in the current realm of what I will call a new spirituality. It suggests a path to find our spiritual connectedness to all of the world around us, a realization that we are each a part of everything,  and that everything is a part of us. It reveals truth as not as description or a concept, but something that simply is. As the author points out, the physical nature of a chair is truth‚Äìits name is just a symbol, a symbol that can take a myriad of forms. I think he feels that a concept like goodness is also a truth that is intrinsically recognized and internal, and not a product of a value system that is imposed on us by others. As is love, and beauty. As do many others, he lauds the innocence of childhood, a time when the truth is real before we become ‚Äúdomesticated‚Äù.  He doesn‚Äôt condemn such domestication, he just says that it is because all of us have been indoctrinated and pass that knowledge on. But, at least to me, he doesn‚Äôt recognize such conditioning as being a necessary part of that portion of our lives when we must learn to cope in our world. I think that this is the message that Richard Rohr sends in ‚ÄúFalling Upward‚Äù.  I can easily be misreading both, but, so be it.

 The striking thing, as I read numerous books and other writings, and watch speeches, is the basic consistency in the message of oneness and the need to abandon, at least temporarily, much of what we have ‚Äúlearned‚Äù in order to open our minds, or perhaps clear our minds, so that we can receive the gift of interconnectedness. Whether this is termed as experiencing heaven, or nirvana, or ‚Äúoneness‚Äù is of no consequence. These are just names for a realization of our humble and insignificant position in a broader, more accepting, and more loving world than most of us witness day to day.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2OHOSSYMDIKDF,J.

210,R2D0N9GEU3NR8N,Simple but deep philosophy with the grandest of aspirations,"The book has the boldest of aspirations, attempting to be in the peer set of sacred religious foundations such as The Bible. The author believes we create our own hell and, through practicing the ""agreements"" in this book, could instead create our own heaven. The core idea of reframing your mental state is well studied and backed up by science, but the degree to which these agreements fulfill such lofty ambitious is an open question. My take is that there's some wisdom that anyone could benefit from, but there's a cloud of poor editing the reader must pass through to access it.

""The dream you are living is your creation. It is your perception of reality that you can change at any time. You have the power to create hell, and you have the power to create heaven.""

Agreement 1: Be Impeccable With Your Word
Similar to the Buddhist eightfold path ""right speech"". They mean speech that doesn't go against yourself. This is both negative self-talk as well as unkind words towards others, because that comes back against us
* If I see you in the street and I call you stupid, it appears that I‚Äôm using the word against you. But really I‚Äôm using my word against myself, because you‚Äôre going to hate me for this, and your hating me is not good for me.
* Using the analogy of the human mind as a computer, gossip can be compared to a computer virus. A computer virus is a piece of computer language written in the same language all the other codes are written in, but with a harmful intent. This code is inserted into the program of your computer when you least expect it and most of the time without your awareness. After this code has been introduced, your computer doesn‚Äôt work quite right.
* Impeccability of the word will also give you immunity from anyone putting a negative spell on you. You will only receive a negative idea if your mind is fertile ground for that idea.

Agreement 2: Don't Take Anything Personally.
Like David Foster Wallace's ""This is water"", we have a rather selfish view that the world revolves around us. Instead, we must love ourselves and refuse to take the ""poison"" others may inflict towards us.
* Even when a situation seems so personal, even if others insult you directly, it has nothing to do with you. What they say, what they do, and the opinions they give are according to the agreements they have in their own minds.
* Even the opinions you have about yourself are not necessarily true; therefore, you don‚Äôt need to take whatever you hear in your own mind personally.
* All the sadness and drama you have lived in your life was rooted in making assumptions and taking things personally.

Agreement 3: Don't Make Assumptions.
We view the actions of others through a filter. Instead, we can practice mindfulness and accept things as they are without associating baggage.
* We make assumptions about what others are doing or thinking ‚Äî we take it personally ‚Äî then we blame them and react by sending emotional poison with our word.
* We only see what we want to see, and hear what we want to hear. We don‚Äôt perceive things the way they are.

Agreement 4: Always Do Your Best.
In every moment, give it your best. Even the seemingly inconsequential you now give your all. But note this is not about perfection, we are human and can accept our actions as long as we try our best.
* When you overdo, you deplete your body and go against yourself, and it will take you longer to accomplish your goal. But if you do less than your best, you subject yourself to frustrations, self-judgment, guilt, and regrets.
* If you don‚Äôt judge yourself there is no way you are going to suffer from guilt, blame, and self-punishment.
* When you always do your best, you take action. Doing your best is taking the action because you love it, not because you‚Äôre expecting a reward.
* When you do your best you learn to accept yourself. But you have to be aware and learn from your mistakes. Learning from your mistakes means you practice, look honestly at the results, and keep practicing.
* You do your best because you want to do it, not because you have to do it, not because you are trying to please
* I make everything a ritual, and I always do my best. Taking a shower is a ritual for me, and with that action I tell my body how much I love it.

Quotes that provide a summary of the author's views
* The best way to say, ‚ÄúThank you, God,‚Äù is by letting go of the past and living in the present moment, right here and now. Whatever life takes away from you, let it go.
* The real you is still a little child who never grew up. Sometimes that little child comes out when you are having fun or playing, when you feel happy, when you are painting, or writing poetry, or playing the piano, or expressing yourself in some way. These are the happiest moments of your life ‚Äî when the real you comes out, when you don‚Äôt care about the past and you don‚Äôt worry about the future.
* Develop awareness of all the self-limiting, fear-based beliefs that make you unhappy.
* You achieve the Mastery of Transformation by changing the fear-based agreements that make you suffer, and reprogramming your own mind, in your own way.
* Going to the core of those agreements is what I call going into the desert. When you go into the desert you meet your demons face-to-face. After coming out of the desert, all those demons become angels.
* Happiness is a choice, and so is suffering.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2D0N9GEU3NR8N,Emily,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on January 17, 2021",True,88 people found this helpful,1878424319,,,

241,RF7WRSANN39IR,"Balanced, easy, and REALISTIC!","As a long-time Feeding Littles follower, I preordered this book back in March and it was well worth the wait. In a world where social media has convinced us that every lunchbox needs to be a completely homemade, Pinterest-perfect, culinary masterpiece, it is SO refreshing to have ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt even‚Äù (as Megan and Judy lovingly call it) options that are still healthy and balanced. As a busy working mom who often suffers from decision fatigue, it is SO nice to have one less thing on my mental plate. My 3-year-old is a selective eater, we follow a vegetarian diet, and her school is nut-free, so packing lunches can be tricky, but every single lunchbox in the book contains meatless, allergen-friendly, AND picky-eater-approved alternatives, which I am so grateful for. The photos are also beautiful and make it easy for my toddler to choose the lunches that are most appealing to her. I also love that many of the lunches use packaged and premade foods (which can of course be substituted for a homemade version if desired). As a household that does rely on packaged options for many snacks and meals, it is validating to know that they can still be part of a nutritious lunchbox. Overall, this book is amazing and makes packing lunches feel doable and even FUN!

246,R2WXUNNS0CUFGI,Review for caregivers of selective (picky) eaters,"There are a lot of reviews on what a great book this is.  If you are like me, you‚Äôre thinking ‚Äúgreat, but my family is different.  Will it work for us?‚Äù  This review is for the parents of selective (picky) eaters.  My boys both have autism.  They probably eat less than 20 foods.  Even most kid-food they don‚Äôt touch.  So why do I love this book?  ‚ù§Ô∏è
  First of all, if you follow Feeding Littles you know there is no judgment.  It is really hard to get my boys to eat something other than a PB&J (three times a day).  I love that the authors ‚Äúget it‚Äù that your kiddo might not eat some things, and it is not a reflection on you as a parent.  I struggle so much with providing balanced food choices but also food my kids will eat.  Then there is a lot of text with tons of helpful info in the front half of the book.  They explain their lunch formula to help you guide you to packing a great lunch with whatever you have at home.  I really appreciated the sections on picky eaters as well as how the cafeteria environment can affect what your kid does/does not eat.  They walk through examples of a lunch and how you can modify it each day to mix it up just a little.  One example used PB&J which is the safe food of choice for my son.
  The rest of the book is sample lunches.  Real actual photos of lunches.  There are so many photos!  My boys can be super selective but books and pictures help them get excited about a new food.  Some families just put a small portion of a new food on a plate, we start with just looking at a photo.  It is a great way to talk about the texture and appearance of a food and prepare to taste it.  I can show the picture and they can point to what they want or what they are willing to try.  Choices and questions can overwhelm them, so a visual picture they can point to is SUPER HELPFUL.  Lunches they ‚Äúwant‚Äù get packed and ‚Äúwilling to try‚Äù we plan to introduce on weekends when their safe foods are nearby.  Did I mention there is a ‚Äúpicky eating tip‚Äù on EVERY SINGLE LUNCH!!  ü§Ø  GF/DF/SF?  Yup there are allergy swaps on most lunches as well.
  Having a book where my boys can point to something to try in their lunch AND takes little prep work on my part‚Ä¶ it is truly a gift.  I hope that this review gives you the confidence to give this book a try.

249,R1X2OACLEDADD0,Real Lunches for Real Families,"I want to preface my review by saying I've bought so many lunchbox recipe books only to be disappointed because they featured recipes my picky kids would never actually eat.

My oldest started Kindergarten this month and I've been faced with a new dilemma- packing lunches that are healthy, appeal to his picky nature, and are still tasty cold as there's no option to heat his food up. And he's expressed disgust with the warm food the cafeteria serves- so that's out for now.

I pre‚Äêordered this book with little preview of the recipes inside but was prepared for another dud. I was expecting to return the book before it even arrived based on past experiences. I was wrong.

This book is EXACTLY what I needed. It's not a recipe book. It's a suggestion book filled with so many great combinations my tired brain wouldn't think of by itself. Best of all, the suggestions are easy and realistic. It features foods that are in a standard fridge/pantry and food picky kids would actually eat.

Important note: this is not a recipe book.
It's an idea idea book! There are millions of recipes on the internet for free, and that's not what I needed. Sometimes a tired parent doesn't know what they don't know and just needs a single place with healthy food pairing ideas. This book is that and more.

I already love this book so much. I hadn't heard of the authors before and bought this book with my own money. As someone who rarely leaves reviews, the fact that I felt compelled to write review this because the book exceeded my expectations says a lot.

I highly recommend this book for parents who need healthy, delicious ideas but don't want to break the bank and can't (or don't want to) spend excessive time preparing gourmet lunches or cutting foods into cutesy shapes for a lunchbox. I will definitely be checking out the rest of these authors' offerings.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1X2OACLEDADD0,Amazon Customer,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on August 29, 2024",True,One person found this helpful,0593797450,,,
250,R37H3EPU85DMXT,NOT a recipe book‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs a good thing!,"I‚Äôve followed Feeding Littles on facebook for several years and really feel like they‚Äôre a valuable team - as professional experts on feeding/nutrition, but also as fellow parents. Tons of tips on feeding picky eaters, babies/toddlers, along with‚Ä¶regular eaters.

During the year, our school system provides free meals countywide. But we were panicked when summer camp began and we were faced with the daunting task of packing lunches every day, and trying to maintain some level of health in what we were sending. Alas, it was mostly an uncrustable, fruit, some crunchy pre-packaged snacks, and a dessert. But what about if you can‚Äôt send peanut products? What if your kid gets bored with eating the same thing every day? THIS is when I wanted this book, and reluctantly had to wait until after the free lunches resumed for it to be released, but we made it!

I‚Äôm thrilled to have this book. It might even help us adults pack our own lunches! It‚Äôs just so easy to get into a rut, overwhelmed, and not know what else to try‚Ä¶but these are SO many ideas to inspire. We‚Äôre lucky enough to have a pretty adventurous eater at home, but even our daughter still has days where she won‚Äôt eat her ‚Äòfavorite‚Äô foods.

251,RCCFGV5K2ZIW3,My Life-Saving Trauma Bible,"‚ÄúI think this man is suffering from memories.‚Äù

So, this book changed my life. No, really. In fact, it‚Äôs *saved* it.

I have severe PTSD. And despite years of therapy, it seemed to be getting worse instead of better. My flashbacks were occurring more and more often. I was becoming more and more lethargic and frozen in time. And suicide was constantly just *there* in my mind. Constant. I‚Äôd even set a date.

And then my insurance quit paying for my therapy.

As a last, desperate grasp for help, I started to read this book.

I have never read anything more validating and more hopeful. To see the brain scans and hear the science that explained *exactly* what has happened to my brain, what is going on during my flashbacks and why I‚Äôm always physically sick‚Äîall the times I‚Äôve gone to a doctor in pain or feeling like I‚Äôm having a heart attack or a stroke only to be told they can‚Äôt find anything wrong‚Äîbrought me to tears. It gave me all the answers I‚Äôve been searching for. It gave everything a scientific, medical explanation‚Äîand a path to *healing*.

He explained why all of my EMDR therapy wasn‚Äôt working‚Äîit was because my therapists (bless them!) were doing it wrong. And I‚Äôve been able to take what I‚Äôve learned from my therapists and this book and do EMDR on my own, and today... today I feel more like my old, genuine self, than I have in *years*. The shadow of suicidal thoughts no longer follows me. I feel *light*. And I have *hope*‚Äîgenuine *hope*‚Äîthat I actually *can* get better! I‚Äôm always telling people *they* can get better and there‚Äôs hope for *them*... but I haven‚Äôt felt that way about myself. Now, I do. I haven‚Äôt had that hope in a long, *long* time. And I even think, after years of struggling and finally making such great progress in such a short time, maybe‚Äîjust maybe‚ÄîI can be cured. I never thought I‚Äôd say that! The future is so exciting to me now!

If you have trauma, do be warned‚ÄîDr. van der Kolk talks a lot about his clients and their traumatic experiences and it can be very triggering. Some of the details I felt he definitely could‚Äôve left out, honestly. However, the scientific information, the validation and the information on how to heal trauma, has made this book absolutely *priceless* to me. It‚Äôs my trauma bible. I‚Äôll be re-reading it in the future and constantly referring to it.

Edit: I keep seeing reviews on here from people who were super upset by the story of the Vietnam vet who murdered a family, raped the mother and left her to die. Honestly, I flipped out at that part, too (aka, had a flashback), in large part because I misunderstood what Dr. van der Kolk was trying to say. I thought for a moment that he was trying to justify what the man did, and had to email my old therapist about it. She read the scene and encouraged me to reread his conclusion, and pointed out to me that he‚Äôs actually saying how difficult it was to try to treat him objectively because what the man had done was an absolute atrocity. He never actually justifies it. He calls it an atrocity. It‚Äôs just worded weird, and if you‚Äôre already triggered by what you‚Äôve just read, it is *easily* misunderstood. I hope he clarifies this in future editions. You have to keep in mind that, van der Kolk‚Äôs target audience is actually other therapists. For this reason, it *was* difficult for me to read. I was violently attacked and molested at 5-years-old and repeatedly raped and abused as a teenager. His going over other people‚Äôs abuse is overly detailed at times and I had to skip many of those scenes.

However, I don‚Äôt hold any of this against him at all. The information in this book has changed my life, I feel seen and validated, and I stand by that almost a year after reading it. I keep it right on my writing desk where it‚Äôs easily found for reference. Am I cured yet? No. Did my flashbacks stop? Nope. This year has been an unexpected nightmare full of triggers. But I‚Äôve made *so* much progress. And I have hope. And that‚Äôs what I need to make it through each day. I sincerely believe that, through a lot of work (which I‚Äôm willing to do!), I can be cured in time. And all of that started with this book.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RCCFGV5K2ZIW3,S.

252,R29FS8XHBYX3RA,Buy this book!,"Psychiatrist, professor, world-class researcher, and traumatologist Bessel van der Kolk MD requires no introduction to trauma psychotherapists. My enduring impressions of him over many years is one of relevance, cogency, frankness, and accessibility - served up with a subtle dash of impishness. He tends to be a bit disruptive - something of a provocateur - and everything of his I have ever read has taught me something, confirmed something important, or pushed my thinking in a new direction. When he has something to say, I want to hear it.

However, I almost didn't buy this book: I was put off by the title. Familiar with major reviews of PTSD psychotherapy outcomes research, I know that research support for body-oriented approaches to treating psychological trauma psychopathology is thin at best, and such treatment models simply do not have the research validation of either EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) and PE (Prolonged Exposure), neither of which are especially body-focused.

J. Interlandi's excellent article anticipating publication of this book - &#34;A Revolutionary Approach to Treating PTSD&#34; (New York Times Magazine, 2014.05.22 - available online) - initially supported my fears that for some inexplicable reason van der Kolk was now promoting some treatment model for which we have little confirming research. &#34;Psychomotor therapy is neither widely practiced nor supported by clinical studies,&#34; Interlandi informs us. Provocateur he may be, but I'm strongly biased in favor of paying attention to therapies for which we do have solid empirical validation. Our clients do not deserve to be experimental subjects - maybe not even if they agree to this, as I'm not sure they can ever know enough to make a truly  informed consent. Knowledge that PTSD and related disorders are usually highly curable, when using the right treatment protocols, sadly remains the possession of a minority of people, even in the professional psychotherapy world.

Yet the account of van der Kolk's therapy work in Interlandi's article is gripping. Becoming completely absorbed in the account, I was convinced. (I've been here before, reading van der Kolk's own accounts of his work.) And so the disruption begins! Deeper into the article, he has me. Van der Kolk's critique of CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy - a general class of therapies) and PE (E. Foa's exposure therapy model) is withering and correct: neither really work. &#34;Trauma has nothing whatsoever to do with cognition...It has to do with your body being reset to interpret the world as a dangerous place....It's not something you can talk yourself out of.&#34; Interlandi reports that &#34;That view places him on the fringes of the psychiatric mainstream.&#34;

But he's right, and I can't stress this enough. Why? Because as a trauma treatment professional I'm well aware of what the trauma treatment outcomes research actually says. The best current summary of this research well may be chapter 2 of Ecker, et al.'s (2012) &#34;Unlocking the emotional brain&#34;. (Buy this book, too!) Ecker et al. brilliantly presents a synthetic summary that encompasses 11 existing therapy models which actually DO cure trauma psychopathology, if done right. In this context, what van der Kolk is doing makes perfect sense. Finally, it appears, the trauma psychotherapy field is moving toward a consensus which has strong credibility.

Van der Kolk's new book has many virtues. Parts One and Two (102 pp) provide a substantial review of the neuropsychology of trauma's impact on a person. It's fun, interesting, informative reading, for professional and layperson alike. Part Three (64 pp) surveys childhood development, attachment experience, and &#34;the hidden epidemic of developmental trauma&#34;. Van der Kolk has for years been a leading champion of the idea that there is a type of PTSD which substantially differs from all the rest. It develops in response to chronic child abuse and/or neglect. I completely share his belief that the diagnosis of Developmental Trauma Disorder (sometimes called C-PTSD, with &#34;C&#34; meaning &#34;Complex&#34;) is overdue for formal recognition. I find his review of the struggle to legitimize DTD as gripping and distressing as anything else in the book. It is anguishing to know that a major problem exists, AND that the psychiatric establishment simply refuses to acknowledge it. DTD/C-PTSD is no fantasy. We see and treat these people, as children and adults. They exist, and they are nothing like &#34;ordinary&#34; PTSD treatment clients.

Part Four (29 pp) focuses on memory. I've long thought that much writing on treating psychological trauma seems to miss the point: trauma memory is what causes the problem. Deal with that and the symptoms vanish. Why is this so hard to understand? Yet, it is not a common understanding at all. Explaining how trauma memory works is invariably enlightening to my clients. And experiencing what happens when we change the nature of trauma memory is revelatory to someone who's lived with it for years, if not decades. As he does throughout the book, van der Kolk offers fine stories about clients who have experienced exactly what I've seen happen in my clients, making excellent use of what cognitive research tells us: people understand things best through narratives. Offer a good narrative and you convince.

Psychological trauma therapy is complex, but we are now well prepared to launch into the book's core content - Part Five (154 pp), &#34;Paths to Recovery&#34;. He gets right to it: we cannot undo the trauma, but we CAN undo its effect on us, and so get our &#34;self&#34; back. Ch. 13 reviews existing therapies. His approach is to repair &#34;Descartes' Error&#34; (see Dam√°sio's  1994 book of that title) by viewing mind and body as a single coherent functional unit. His topical coverage is complete and his critique of current therapies acute - not to be missed.

He then writes of the importance of language (Ch. 14). We construct our narrative mainly in words, and the words we choose are critical. But language is not enough (this anticipates his next two chapters). Our senses encompass a larger world, and it's center is our body, where all our sensory receptors are located. Then he introduces the treatment model he's long advocated: EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). I'm trained in EMDR, and in fact van der Kolk and I had the same instructor for our advanced training: Gerald Puk PhD. Van der Kolk tells an amusing and self-deprecating story about his advanced training experience, in which Puk was able to provide a strong corrective to his approach to clients. This is typical van der Kolk - he's a truth-teller, even when it may put him in a poor light! And,after all, at this point he has nothing to prove to anyone.

Finding an EMDR therapist is not hard (see his &#34;Resources&#34; section). Nor is it hard to find a yoga instructor, and yoga is what he advises for helping a trauma victim get back into their body. Yoga is a wise choice, because it is available, already widely known, and adaptable to a wide range of individuals and capabilities.

There is much more in Part Five, and the focus is on self-empowerment. &#34;Victim no more!&#34; as they say. Most trauma therapists have a keen interest in seeing their clients leave therapy charged up and ready to fully embrace their life - that certainly is my own emphasis. Van der Kolk's thoughts on self-empowerment for those in recovery from psychological trauma will be invaluable to any trauma psychotherapy client.

For psychotherapy professionals, this book will be both delightful and confirming. For everyone else, it will be a readable, gripping, highly educational tour of topics all of which are critical to a successful transition back from the impact of psychological trauma. That he gives prominent though not dominating emphasis to developmental trauma disorders is entirely appropriate. Our society has yet to grasp that child abuse and neglect is a more often chronic than not, and that its impact is largely ignored and poorly treated, if at all. This does not have to be. Get educated (this book will do that), then commit to being an advocate for children as well as for adults impacted by trauma. They all deserve the chance to be healed, and we can now do that. Van der Kolk shows us how.

The physical book: Jacket design is pleasant and interesting. Binding is less so: color of spine wrapping is semi-florescent, and of paper, not cloth. The book feels substantial and pleasant to hold and look at.

254,RK53QEDXTKPY1,Journey Through Trauma Healing,"""The Body Keeps the Score"" by Bessel van der Kolk is not just a book; it's a guiding light through the labyrinth of trauma, offering profound insights and practical tools for healing. As someone who has experienced trauma firsthand, this book has been nothing short of life-changing in my journey towards understanding and processing my experiences.

Comprehensive Understanding: One of the most remarkable aspects of this book is its comprehensive exploration of trauma and its effects on the brain, mind, and body. Van der Kolk draws upon decades of research and clinical experience to provide a deep understanding of how trauma manifests physically, emotionally, and psychologically. His insights shed light on the complex interplay between trauma and various mental health conditions, offering clarity and validation to those who have struggled to make sense of their experiences.

Holistic Approach: ""The Body Keeps the Score"" emphasizes the importance of taking a holistic approach to trauma healing, addressing not only the psychological aspects but also the physiological and relational dimensions of trauma. Van der Kolk explores a range of therapeutic modalities, from traditional talk therapy to innovative approaches such as EMDR and neurofeedback, demonstrating how each can play a vital role in the healing process. This holistic perspective resonated deeply with me, providing a roadmap for integrating mind, body, and spirit in my own healing journey.

Practical Tools: What sets ""The Body Keeps the Score"" apart is its emphasis on practical tools and techniques for healing. Van der Kolk offers a wealth of exercises and strategies that readers can incorporate into their daily lives to regulate their nervous systems, cultivate self-awareness, and foster resilience in the face of trauma. From mindfulness practices to yoga and creative expression, these tools empower readers to take an active role in their healing journey, offering hope and agency amidst the darkness of trauma.

Validation and Empowerment: Perhaps the most profound impact of ""The Body Keeps the Score"" is its validation of the trauma survivor's experience and its message of empowerment. Van der Kolk emphasizes that healing is possible, that survivors are not defined by their trauma, and that they have the capacity to reclaim agency and meaning in their lives. This message of hope and empowerment is a beacon of light for anyone who has felt lost or hopeless in the aftermath of trauma.

In conclusion, ""The Body Keeps the Score"" is a masterpiece of trauma literature that offers profound insights, practical guidance, and unwavering hope to trauma survivors and professionals alike. It has helped me navigate the darkest corners of my psyche, find solace in the embrace of community, and reclaim a sense of agency and purpose in my life. If you have experienced trauma or work with trauma survivors, I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It has the power to transform lives and ignite a path towards healing, one page at a time.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RK53QEDXTKPY1,JBM,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on May 17, 2024",True,21 people found this helpful,0143127748,,,
255,R1IOO6NXQ4IO46,Fascinating Read,"If you‚Äôve experienced trauma, or if you know someone who‚Äôs experienced trauma, or you just want to have a better understanding of the impact trauma has on people, commit to reading this book. It is insightful and eye opening. It will make you frustrated to have some understanding of the brain/mind/body connection in response to trauma and realize there are so many more things that can and should be done to help traumatized people heal that simply are dismissed in favor of throwing medication at the problem.

256,R2ROCOK0J6HOY0,I'm So Glad I Read This Book!,"Wow! The Body Keeps the Score has so much information in it! I‚Äôm not great at reading technical books, especially if they are science related. Yeah. I‚Äôm more of a language arts and social studies kind of gal! I have gotten better since I taught sixth grade science, but technical brain stuff still confuses me a bit. Thankfully, Bessel Van Der Kolk does his best to explain things so that even I can understand them. I may have needed to reread some paragraphs a couple of times, but I did finally understand it.

The Body Keeps the Score is so well written. Like I said, even I was able to understand it. The writing style may be more technical, but it is still usually easy to understand. If you‚Äôre like me and know very little about the brain, you‚Äôll be good! He does a good job of explaining all the different parts of the brain and how trauma affects each of those parts.

I learned a lot from the examples he shares of his clients and how they have reacted to traumatic experiences. It‚Äôs crazy how the same situation can cause such different reactions! In one person the experience can cause the person‚Äôs brain to pretty much shut down, while someone else‚Äôs brain in the same experience can cause more of a fight or flight response. I did find it fascinating to learn about these different responses.

One of the reasons I‚Äôm glad I read The Body Keeps the Score is so that I will be better prepared and be better able to help my friends, family members, and students who have suffered from traumatic experiences. One of my favorite parts was learning about all the different strategies that can be used to help people heal from their trauma. I knew about a few of them, but I learned about several unconventional methods that will help.

I love that healing focuses on body awareness and mindfulness. It‚Äôs all about separating the past and the present and becoming aware of your body. It seems strange, but apparently when you suffer from a traumatic experience, your past and present collide. When something triggers your mind in the present, you feel the same emotions as you did when you first had the experience. At that point it becomes difficult to discern if you are in the present or in the past. Fascinating, right?

257,RJ7OBMRG4H35Q,Please buy this book and start loving your life,"Of all the non-fiction books I've read, this is by far the best one ever. I grew up in a tough way. Lots went wrong. My brother and I believed we were unwanted and we had plenty of evidence to back up our sentiment. We suffered shared abuse and individual abuses of every kind imaginable. When I became an adult, I subscribe to the concepts of people like Rush Limbaugh and drove around listening to his radio show proclaiming that there is no such thing as post-traumatic stress disorder. I believed I could gut it out, that the past was the past and that only weak people needed to talk through their problems. I believed only losers behaved badly as adults due to anything in their childhood or past and that claiming you were affected by any past problem was a crutch to allow you to embrace failure. Frankly, for a time, that approach worked for me. I got married, had some great children (still have them thankfully), built a company. But it didn't take too long until it all came crashing down. And, when it did, I spent nearly 1.5 decades down. The anxiety that was always in my throat and chest was, to put it mildly, a distraction. It's very hard to be kind to people, to focus on your work, to love others when all your power is spent trying to pretend you don't feel like s***. When you can't sleep because your heart is beating so forcefully that the entire bed is vibrating - at least it feels that way - you not only lose the joy of sleep, but you feel hopeless and miserable and even more so when you're not able to understand why you feel this way. When you see everything you have go away and can only occasionally find the strength to take care of yourself and your business and need others in your life to carry you from time to time (much to your embarrassment) and yet you think you're smart and capable and have no understanding of why you are where you are, life becomes a slog. You trudge through it wishing you were dead or that something would kill you even if, like me, you'd never kill yourself. Literally, when I was a believer, I went to bed every night and my prayers went something like this, ""Dear Jesus, please have a bus run over me. I will never kill myself but I'm miserable. Please let me die so my family won't hate me for killing myself but so that I can stop hating the sun coming up. In Jesus name, Amen."" If you're like I was (and it's hard to tell you how I was and hold the tears down even now), this book will help you change all that. It will describe in detail what you're going through and it captures so many of those subtleties as to make it absolutely amazing. For the first time, I don't have depression (and I don't take pills). I don't have anxiety (it still bubbles up on occasion but using mindfulness, it goes nearly as fast as it comes). My life is pointed in the right direction, my business future is hopeful, my love-life is stabilizing, I know I'll no longer lose friends. I'm finally on track to getting what I want in every area of my life from women to money to friends and deep connections with my family. While I can't attribute every part of my success to this book alone as it takes many things to get where you want to go (mostly you), I can absolutely attest to the power of this book. If you've suffered any sort of major and/or persistent trauma in your life, please buy (and read) this book.

My passion for therapy came to be as I learn to heal my self and an anxiety crisis at 19 years with Meditation and Gestalt Therapy in Bogota.

I then went to Psychology school in one of the top 5 universities in my country and found a very disappointing approach to mental health. In none of the classes we were thought about childhood trauma and the impact it can have in our lives.

In my early career as a practicing psychologist I went far away from the academy and isoleted from this evidence based world practicing trauma healing therapy with wathever new age trauma healing theories I could found that really worked.

Now this book has given me a whole new evidence base background to give roots to my work. I am very grateful to Dr Van Der Kolk for this amazing book.

My interest in academics and around trauma healing has grown enourmsly. I have hope that this mindset around society development can reach our politics and practices around my country as well.

This is a fantastic story and a welcome addition to the Mitch Rapp series.

‚ÄúCapture or Kill‚Äù goes back in the timeline and takes place in 2011‚Ä¶an Iranian operative witnesses a demonstration that could change the scope of the conflict in the Middle East.

Before the president can feel comfortable to order the raid, he wants confirmation and proof that bin Laden is indeed at the location. Proof that he trusts to only one man. You guessed it ‚Äî Mitch Rapp.

It‚Äôs a race against time as Rapp tries to prevent a war in the Middle East while helping to deliver justice to the Americans tragically killed on 9/11.

It was also the first CH books I've read, and let me just say, I am floored by how good it was. Absolutely loved the writing style. Theo is a wonderful therapist and gosh, his interactions with Atlas made me laugh. There are some heavy scenes in the books that made me pause, cry, laugh and find closure in some things in my own childhood that was unexpected, but freeing, too. It was real and raw. That's what books bring to my life - a different perspective that heals sometimes. The idea that a story can make someone believe that there is a way out of pain and heartache and that true love can heal all the broken parts of us. Also, the reality of how first love changes us in ways we sometimes cannot understand until years later. Then there is the clarity that comes with knowing that our childhoods shape who we are, but that our future is what we make of it! You can rise above it all.

283,R3V26JPBHR9NSS,Book Review,"Colleen Hoover is a New York Times bestselling author of It Ends With Us(book 1) and It Starts With Us(book 2). In It Starts With Us it begins with Atlas and Lily running into each other. Atlas and Lily may also rekindle their love from when they were teenagers. However, there is a problem with Lily‚Äôs ex-husband who believes Atlas could potentially be the reason his marriage ended with Lily which can potentially harm Lily and Atlas‚Äôs chance at a relationship.
 The novel is a young adult romance that involves some domestic abuse and child abandonment. The title of the book refers to how it ended with Lily and Atlas meeting again at the end of the first book It Ends With Us and in the second book It Starts With Us it begins with Atlas and Lily running into each other. Which explains why the author chose to title the novel. Additionally, throughout the book, it switches between the perspectives of Atlas and Lily in every chapter. Even though the perspective changes it wasn‚Äôt complicated for me to understand what was happening throughout the story. Having two different perspectives helped me understand the views of each character more fully. However, if it is hard for you to keep track when there is more than one perspective then this book may be more difficult.
 Colleen Hoover's writing captivates people who want to read novels. As the second book of a series, it wasn‚Äôt as enjoyable as the first book was, however, it still was an amazing read. The book was fast paced in certain moments but had points where it wasn‚Äôt as fast-paced.
 Before getting into this author's books I wasn‚Äôt reading many books, however, this book was extremely interesting and after I began reading it I finished it in a few days. I would recommend anyone who enjoys romance novels to read this book however the domestic abuse and child abandonment could be harder for some to handle. Although these are difficult topics Colleen Hoover does a good job of making them lighter and more readable, unlike the first book of the series which had more graphic scenes of domestic abuse.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I want to start by saying that for some reason these books are classified as romances in some places, but I personally do not agree with that. I think these fit more as contemporary fiction/women‚Äôs fiction with a romantic storyline. I also think that if you go into reading these with the expectation of them not being romances, you‚Äôll like them more.

There were things I liked about these, and things I disliked. The way they are written really make you feel for Lily and emphasize with the situation she is in. It really showcases how your entire life can become intertwined with someone, which makes removing them from your life difficult. It was a little disappointing to not see her ‚Äúfound family‚Äù step in and intervene a little more though.

There were a couple interactions between Lily and her other friends that seemed weirdly unrealistic (she mentions Devon and her ‚Äúweren‚Äôt really friends‚Äù but they‚Äôre comfortable enough that he can just reach into her dress and fix her bra? Like bruh). Also, Ryle blowing up a photo of Lily and hanging it in his sister‚Äôs apartment is such a weird red flag üö©üö©

Also, I have a love/hate relationship with using diary entries to explain someone‚Äôs past. Sometimes it can feel a bit lazy/boring (which, in this case, it did).

It Starts With Us was pretty average. I was interested in seeing what happened between Lily and Atlas but overall the book fell a little flat for me. There wasn‚Äôt anything wrong with it, it just felt slow to me. I did enjoy seeing the relationship between Atlas and his brother form though.

Overall, if you view these as contemporary fiction (which I did), they‚Äôre an okay read.

289,R35AB9K2RXJOIP,"Amazingly Awesome, Loved, Loved, Loved this Book","Thank you, Colleen Hoover, for giving Lily and Atlas their happily ever after. I truly appreciate it because they are my favorite couple in one of the books. They have now found a place in my top five couples, a list I love to revisit. This story is one of forgiveness and healing. I am so glad that Lily was given the freedom to love who she chooses. There were moments in the book when it seemed touch and go. I imagined various scenarios where Ryle lost control and hurt Lily, but thankfully, it didn't escalate to that. Ryle's issues stem from what was revealed in 'It Ends With Us': he shot his brother with a loaded gun as a child, an event that undoubtedly scarred his psyche. Whether he received help or not, or whether he pretended to be helped or was not encouraged to overcome his issues, remains unclear. Then there's Lily, who grew up in an abusive household and knew she had the strength to walk away if she ever met someone like her father. I am relieved she recognized that abuse is not love. Regardless of Ryle's actions, he always tried to blame her or thought an apology would suffice. I've heard it said that 'sorry' is a word for sorry people, but I don't believe that applies to Ryle. He had a sister who adored him and loving parents, so perhaps the trauma of accidentally killing his brother left him with unresolved anger. Lily, seeking and obtaining a divorce, still faces anger from her ex, who blames Atlas for their breakup rather than acknowledging his own abusive behavior as the cause. Then there's Atlas, dubbed the 'Greek Adonis' by Alyssa, who was abused by his mother‚Äîa twist, as I initially believed it was his stepfather.

His autobiography was very enlightening, and, to be frank, encouraging.  This relatively young man (to me), is extremely articulate, insightful and thoughtful.

His perspective with regard to politics is grounded it the principles on which this Nation (USA) was founded and which have made it so great.

303,R2M9HXDDQKG5O0,Absolutely 5 Stars!,"No wonder ‚ÄúHillbilly Elegy‚Äù by J.D. Vance is #1 on Amazon‚Äôs top purchased books in July 2024, a New York Times Best Seller, and a Netflix movie!!!!!!

(This review does not contain vital spoilers.)

J.D. should be commended for his poignant work, not solely for its exceptional literary quality but for the emotional and informative depth that resonates throughout the narrative. His ability to evoke genuine sentiment is a testament to his storytelling prowess, shocking experiences, and time as a life-long learner. While reading, I had to keep reminding myself that I was reading non-fiction.

His mother was constantly changing up what the ‚ÄúD‚Äù in ‚ÄúJ.D.‚Äù stood for. For me, a humorous moment in the book is when J.D. remarks on his aversion to the name ""Donald."" When writing this, he had no way of knowing who his future running mate for the United States Presidential Candidacy would be 8 years after this masterpiece was published. That made me laugh out loud.

J.D.'s candid portrayal of his family's struggles offers a stark portrayal of small-town America, urging readers to look beyond initial impressions. I can‚Äôt put into words the courage it must have taken him to share the darkest moments and terrible choices of his mother (and other family members) for the world to read about. His courage in revealing personal hardships and familial dynamics underscores the book's authenticity and societal relevance.

J.D.'s exploration of the cyclical nature of poverty, addiction, and fractured families underscores a broader message of resilience and the capacity for change. By drawing parallels between different communities facing systemic challenges, he prompts reflection on shared human experiences and the potential for societal transformation. J.D. proves that we are not facing a race war, but a socioeconomic one right here within our own borders.

J.D. wrote: ‚ÄúMamaw and Papaw taught me that we live in the best and greatest country on earth. This fact gave meaning to my childhood. Whenever times were tough- when I felt overwhelmed by the drama and the tumult of my youth- I knew that better days were ahead because I lived in a country that allowed me to make the good choices that others hadn‚Äôt. (Chapter 11)‚Äù That is the sum of this book.

I wholeheartedly recommend ‚ÄúHillbilly Elegy‚Äù to EVERYONE regardless of political affiliations. It serves as a poignant commentary on humanity, the pursuit of the American Dream, and the resilience inherent in the face of adversity. J.D.'s narrative has the power to inspire and provoke thought, leaving a lasting impact on readers. This is an elegy that will stick with me for so many good reasons.

J.D., if you happen to read this review- Thank you for your service in the Marine Corps. Thank you for sharing this highly personal story. Thank you for standing for what is right. And thank you for agreeing to be our next Vice President. Congratulations to your mom on 10 years of sobriety.

304,R3NGVVIBBGQPKH,"An edifying and inspiring, if also troubling at times, read.","There is a lot to take in here, even for someone that's seen this life up close in many of its many guises.

While ostensibly about the particular culture of the West Virginia Scots-Irish underclass, anyone that has seen white poverty in America's flyover states will recognize much of what is written about here. It is a life on the very edge of plausibility, without the sense of extra-family community that serves as a stabilizing agent in many first-generation immigrant communities or communities of color. Drugs, crime, jail time, abusive interactions without any knowledge of other forms of interaction, children growing up in a wild mix of stoned mother care, foster care, and care by temporary &#34;boyfriends,&#34; and in general, an image of life on the edge of survival where even the heroes are distinctly flawed for lack of knowledge and experience of any other way of living.

This is a story that many of the &#34;upwardly mobile middle class&#34; in the coastal areas, often so quick to judge the lifestyles and politics of &#34;those people&#34; in middle America, has no clue about. I speak from experience as someone that grew up in the heartland but has spent years in often elite circles on either coast.

Two things struck me most about this book.

First, the unflinching yet not judgmental portrayal of the circumstances and of the people involved. It is difficult to write on this subject without either glossing over the ugliness and making warm and fuzzy appeals to idealism and human nature, Hollywood style, or without on the other hand descending into attempts at political persuasion and calls to activism. This book manages to paint the picture, in deeply moving ways, without committing either sin, to my eye.

Second, the author's growing realization, fully present by the end of the work, that while individuals do not have total control over the shapes of their lives, their choices do in fact matter‚Äîthat even if one can't direct one's life like a film, one does always have the at least the input into life that comes from being free to make choices, every day, and in every situation.

It is this latter point, combined with the general readability and writing skill in evidence here, that earns five stars from me. Despite appearances, I found this to be an inspiring book. I came away feeling empowered and edified, and almost wishing I'd become a Marine in my younger days as the author decided to do‚Äîsomething I've never thought or felt before.

I hate to fall into self-analysis and virtue-signaling behavior in a public review, but in this case I feel compelled to say that the author really did leave with me a renewed motivation to make more of my life every day, to respect and consider the choices that confront me much more carefully, and to seize moments of opportunity with aplomb when they present themselves. Given that a Hillbilly like the author can find his way and make good choices despite the obstacles he's encountered, many readers will find themselves stripped bare and exposed‚Äîundeniably ungrateful and just a bit self-absorbed for not making more of the hand we've been dealt every day.

I'm a big fan of edifying reads, and though given the subject matter one might imagine this book to be anything but, in fact this book left me significantly better than it found me in many ways. It also did much to renew my awareness of the differences that define us in this country, and of the many distinct kinds of suffering and heroism that exist.

305,R3LFVSN79ZJEDF,Disappointing and often sterotypical.,"I was a bit confused, is J.D. Vance proud of being from Appalachia who made it to Yale or does it depend on the company he is in. Once while getting gas where his ""hillbilly"" roots are, he lied to someone saying he was not attending Yale. His reason, he didn't want to explain it.

The title, not sure where to land on it. Elegy is reference to poetic so is the title sarcasm as in Hillbilly's don't know poems? I live in Appalachia country, was raised middle class in the mid-west; yet I know people who don't even know the word elegy. Or how about ""Hillbilly""; never really cared for the word myself as it is to subjective and stereotypical.

Clearly Vance had a troubled life, not uncommon in Appalachia; well not uncommon anywhere across the US as it is not specific to Appalachia. He also had some major breaks in the course of his life; breaks had they not come he would not be where he is today.

Vance also doesn't seem to understand he is no longer that young J.D., he is not the person that young version of himself wanted to be, or a version he thought he would be. He is a different J.D. entirely based on education and the network taking him where he is today. He had enough help I wonder is J.D. really where J.D. wants to be or where others thought he should be in order to fit in with those around him?

His solutions is everyone from Appalachia wants to go to Yale, should be able to go to Yale. He doesn't seem to understand not everyone wants what he has. Nor does everyone want to go to Yale.

He gives a mixed message on Ohio State, where he calls it a ""community college"", but a very low college due to his being ""lucky"" and getting accepted to Yale coming from Ohio State.

The book for me was more about the club of Ivy League than about as he termed upward mobility. He then creates a stereotype of Appalachian people giving the impression everyone there wants what he has. Living here, I don't see the same things he describes they want and should have.

Over all it is a good book and I will recommend to others. However, I feel J.D. is still stuck somewhere between who is is, who he was and he wants to be. Like J.D. Vance still struggles to answer this question for himself today.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LFVSN79ZJEDF,A Allord,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2024",True,77 people found this helpful,0062300555,,,

How proud mama wand papaw would feel to know the boy they raised made it. My only objection to the book was the language. I know JD would say the fowl way his family spoke was just being truthful. I feel cursing did indeed epitomize their ignorance. For me, however, I would have preferred the explicative language  was left out.

307,R11BUP7VOAS82T,More questions than answers,"J.D. Vance chronicles his &#34;upwardly mobile&#34; journey from a dirt-poor boy in the backwoods of Kentucky, to a Yale-educated lawyer in Washington D.C. It is quite a journey, to be sure. J.D.'s story is one of family ties, bad choices, cyclical dysfunction, and in some cases, redemption.

&#34;Hillbilly Elegy&#34; first landed on my reading list due to an article in my newsfeed that listed Vance's memoir as potential insight into the group that supposedly swung this year's election in favor of Donald Trump - poor, working-class whites in the country's rust belt. We do indeed get an insider's glimpse into the mindset and lifestyle of the poor, white communities in Appalachia and surrounding regions. Yet politics and analysis is minimal, so any link between the group in question and our president is left mostly as an exercise for the reader.

The book is fascinating on many levels, the least of which was the dichotomy between the strong family ties upon which the hillbillies draw their strength and honor, and the dysfunction, cheating, brawling, and deep-seated anger present in their everyday lives. Blood is indeed, thicker than water.

To me, the real question is just how we break the cycle of poverty and bad choices. One particular story Vance relays typifies the scenario played out over and over in his community. A young man with a pregnant girlfriend landed a decent job in a tile warehouse. This man was chronically late, missed work at least once a week, and took hour-long bathroom breaks. Though warned repeatedly, his behavior did not change. Yet when he was finally fired, he lashed out at the manager for being inconsiderate of his difficult home situation (which, of course, he created in the first place!).

This mindset of blaming others is very prevalent throughout the book. The author, however, places some of the blame at the foot of the conservative rhetoric - instead of pushing the poor to engage their issues, &#34;the message of the right is increasingly: It‚Äôs not your fault that you‚Äôre a loser; it‚Äôs the government‚Äôs fault.&#34; I think this is a bit of a cop out, and to be honest, struck me as pandering to liberal elite that runs most of the media in this country. I would suggest that the creation of our massive welfare state, and the dependence of the poor on government handouts with little to no accountability is much more responsible for the poor's inability to truly confront their station in life.

Similarly, Vance takes some time to disparage evangelical theology as taught by the church his dad attended. To be sure, there is often much to disparage. In fact, the suspicion of science and government held by his dad's church mirrors the attitude of many of my fellow evangelical brothers and sisters. Yet, the irony that his dad's home life was one of the few peaceful and stable families in his entire existence is not lost on Vance. In fact, he admits, &#34;Dad embodied a phenomenon social scientists have observed for decades: Religious folks are much happier. Regular church attendees commit fewer crimes, are in better health, live longer, make more money, drop out of high school less frequently, and finish college more frequently than those who don‚Äôt attend church at all.&#34;

Sometimes I think society at large wants the results of what they find in the church and organized religion, yet chafe at the thought of being told what to do, and what behavior is acceptable and what is not. The fact that possibly you can't get one without the other is a possibility our &#34;enlightened&#34; minds simply do not want to consider. And what is it, exactly, that these church-going people find at church? It's not a &#34;phenomenon,&#34; as Vance categorizes it, but the power of Jesus Christ.

I feel I would be remiss, as well, at this point not to push back against a sentiment Vance conveys as popular truth - evangelical churches are shedding members at an alarming rate. As a proof-point, he references an article from the Huffington Post that makes the tired claim that evangelicalism is being rejected by the current generation. Huffington Post, the darling child of hipsters and liberals everywhere, has never been a friend of evangelicals, and I would hope other, more balanced studies would be considered. The book, &#34;Christians are Hate-Filled Hypocrites...And Other Lies You've Been Told&#34; is a good place to start. Using strong scientific and statistical analysis, it directly refutes some of the very studies mentioned in the HP article. Anyway, I digress. Admittedly, conservative politics and the supposed failure of evangelicalism are overall a smaller focus in the book.

For the most part, Vance simply recounts the story of his life, and that of his closest relatives. It is fascinating, heart-breaking, and often akin to watching the proverbial train wreck. In fact, I wonder if that is one reason the book has been so popular. For most of us, we can read about the dysfunction so prevalent in Vance's upbringing and pat ourselves on the back - we're not perfect, but at least we're not as bad as that Vance clan!

Only near the end of the book, in Chapter 14, does Vance attempt some deeper analysis and retrospective thinking. And I would hope we would do the same. The situation surrounding poor, working-class whites in the Midwest, similar to that surrounding African Americans in urban settings, is complex and difficult, with no easy answers. But that doesn't mean we should't still be tackling these inconvenient issues. Everything from how we respond to the poor, to how we treat our spouse, is on the table.

I appreciate Vance airing out his dirty laundry. I doubt many of us would want our family's deepest and darkest secrets to be exposed in a book for all to read. But in doing so, he gives us the opportunity to participate in the plight of an entire segment of our population that, until the last year, was rarely spoken of.

308,R1BQNJE18H32U4,Wow ! What an uplifting story & a wonderful person,"This book really was moving & powerful, there‚Äôs something about JD‚Äôs story that really has a major impact on you while you‚Äôre reading it. I had no idea who JD Vance was before being chosen as VP nominee, I‚Äôd seen people on the news insulting JD & tearing him down with demeaning remarks about him. Those people could not be more wrong, & I understand now why the people on the news are so eager to attack people like JD Vance, they have a tremendous dislike, even a hatred for Regular Americans. If you are not one of them, if you‚Äôre not part of their elite society & pedigree then they see us as beneath them, we are lesser than‚Äôs in their eyes & their disdain for regular people burns strong. So when I saw them pile on the attacks against JD Vance they showed their true selves, they hate the fact that someone like JD, a regular small town boy from a poor & broken family with serious struggles & obstacles, the elites in the news media hate it that someone like him earned his way to major success & out of a life of poverty & struggles. Doesn‚Äôt matter that it‚Äôs JD, it could be any one of us, we‚Äôre tolerated as long as we mind our place & obey while keeping silent, but the moment one of us makes the climb out the elites will be there to stomp on you & push you back down where they think we belong. I hadn‚Äôt voted since 2016 & I‚Äôm not a fan of Trump but after reading this & seeing how the news media is so badly treating JD Vance I‚Äôm voting for Trump - Vance this election simply bc JD being nominated for VP showed a side of the media that was very unsettling, their hatred & disgust for regular, everyday people.

309,R3IC0RFHR8SIVG,"An excellent, thought-provoking story","I saw the movie before reading the book, and the movie makes a few changes. But the basic storyline remains the same. The author gives a description of his family and how his grandparents moved to Middletown, OH to find employment in the steel mill there. They made a mostly middle-class life there, but as time went on, family troubles reared their ugly head beginning before the author's birth. He found himself in an unstable family situation with an abusive mother and her revolving door of relationships, partners, boyfriends, and the occasional ex-husband. His grandmother took an interest and he was able to turn his life around and discover a way out of that place and life. He states that just living his life has taught him things that the average person in Middletown would have no way of knowing. He was able to achieve an amazing amount of upward mobility by making some smart choices and being willing to set goals and work for them.

His concern is that he sees the people from his hometown and many others like them slipping into an abyss of poverty, addiction, and abuse. Some of this is self-inflicted, and that the people seem to have lost their drive, ambition, and upward mobility. He fears that we stand to lose a large segment of society because of these problems, and states that society cannot afford to let its working-class people sink into quicksand. It goes contrary to the American Dream, but he said it's telling that several European countries are doing the American Dream better than we do here because their working classes have experienced far more upward mobility than ours has.

He does not claim to have a sweeping solution nor all the answers to every question or concern. But he is right to be concerned. Call the book the canary in the coal mine who might be chirping just before it's too late. Also, it's a terrible shame that this book will be given some kind of knee-jerk discrediting because the author espouses politically conservative viewpoints. This is not a conservative book.

310,RHEVLIJH63OAF,This book degenerates the hillbilly and says that they are beyond hope since they can't pull themselves up by their bootstrap,"ance uses his life story and that of his family and extended family in order to explain the cultural and economical ways of the hillbilly. Just what is a hillbilly? Generally, they are someone who is from the Appalachian Mountain region who is poor, rural, and working class. Sometimes undereducated. The stereotype has them with no teeth because they drink Moutain Dew and don't go to the dentist.  Also that they are gun happy people ready to use them especially if you get their daughter pregnant.  The heavy popping of opioid pills such as Percocet and Oxy began in the mountains of West Virginia and Kentucky, which is where the term &#34;pillbilly&#34; comes from.

Vance's Mamaw and Pawpaw came from a holler in Kentucky called Jackson. He got her pregnant at the age of thirteen and the two took the famous Route 23 out of Kentucky to Ohio (sometimes referred to as &#34;Middletucky&#34;) where a good job at a steel manufacturer, Amaco, awaited.  They weren't the only ones. Plenty of people from Appalachia left for jobs in Michigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania (or &#34;Pennsyltucky&#34;), and Illinois. In the 1950s thirteen out of one hundred in Kentucky took the hillbilly highway out and in Harlan County Kentucky, thirty percent of its population, mostly coal miners, left.

Life was hard for his Mamaw and Pawpaw. She had several miscarriages and three children that survived.  These included Uncle Jimmy, Aunt Wee, and his mother.  His Pawpaw was an alcoholic and things could get ugly in their house.  He would straighten himself out and while he and his wife stayed married they would end up with their own separate homes once their kids were grown, but remained close.  But heaven help anyone who bothered one of the children or a member of the family. When Uncle Jimmy was five, he saw a toy in the pharmacy that he wanted for Christmas and his parents told him to go in and look at it while they finished shopping at a store. When he picked it up to play with it, the clerk in the store told him that he wasn't allowed to touch the toy and kicked the boy out of the pharmacy.  When his parents found him and found out what happened they went in and trashed the place and stood up for their son's honor, because how dare someone tell their son that he can't come in their store.

He would take a while to adjust to a new place as his mother moved him and his older sister, Lydnsey, around to different homes with different men.  The one constant was his Mamaw's place.  Life with his mother was hard as she had a temper and in her relationships, fighting was the only way she knew how to deal with things. So dishes went flying and she would get violent with the men in her life.

According to J.D., this was how most hillbillies acted. Also, they spent money they didn't have at Christmas on fancy gifts for the kids, hoping the IRS refund check would cover it.  Sometimes there would be someone in the house with a substance abuse problem.  In J.D.'s case, it was his mother who got hooked on pills.  They also abuse the Welfare system and try to get out of work if they can.

Vance basically says that you have to pull yourself up by your bootstraps, but most of these people don't have boots. And he had helped himself.  His Mamaw received a pension check from his Papaw when he died and likely social security.  He credits his Mamaw, his sister, his teachers, and the Marines with helping him to avoid going down the wrong path and instead earning his degree at Ohio State and his law degree at Yale, something practically unheard of from where he was from.  He offers a lot of criticism but no solutions and he overgeneralizes and forgets the people in his life that weren't loud and violent like his sister and Uncle Jimmy and Aunt Wee and cousin Gail and their spouses.  It's like he wants them to be the exception that proves the rule, but there are more of them in his life than the violent argumentative types.  Also, I think there are plenty of people who are dying to get jobs of any kind if you just give them a chance.  And there are programs that train people in Appalachia to learn a new trade for a company that is in the area.  Vance is close to using stereotypes, though with stereotypes there is some truth to them.  Read this book with caution.

*Vance is contemplating a run for office and it is my opinion that he wrote this book as a stepping stone for this purpose. But that is just my opinion.

* I add this as I think it might be interesting and be a counterpoint to the book.

 I was born in poverty in Appalachia. ‚ÄòHillbilly Elegy‚Äô doesn‚Äôt speak for me.

J.D. Vance, author of ‚ÄúHillbilly Elegy,‚Äù in Washington in January. (Astrid Riecken/For The Washington Post)

By Betsy Rader September 1, 2017

Betsy Rader is an employment lawyer at Betsy Rader Law LLC, located in Chagrin Falls, Ohio. She is running as a Democrat to represent Ohio‚Äôs 14th Congressional District in the U.S. House.

J.D. Vance‚Äôs book ‚ÄúHillbilly Elegy,‚Äù published last year, has been assigned to students and book clubs across the country. Pundits continue to cite it as though the author speaks for all of us who grew up in poverty. But Vance doesn‚Äôt speak for me, nor do I believe that he speaks for the vast majority of the working poor.

From a quick glance at my r√©sum√©, you might think me an older, female version of Vance. I was born in Appalachia in the 1960s and grew up in the small city of Newark, Ohio. When I was 9, my parents divorced. My mom became a single mother of four, with only a high school education and little work experience. Life was tough; the five of us lived on $6,000 a year.

Like Vance, I attended Ohio State University on scholarship, working nights and weekends. I graduated at the top of my class and, again like Vance, attended Yale Law School on a financial-need scholarship. Today, I represent people who‚Äôve been fired illegally from their jobs. And now that I‚Äôm running for Congress in Northeast Ohio, I speak often with folks who are trying hard but not making much money.

Although high school graduation rates are rising and there are more private and federal grants available, most low-income students have a tough time attending and staying in college. Here are nine facts about poor students and the college experience. (Video: Claritza Jimenez/Photo: iStock/The Washington Post)

A self-described conservative, Vance largely concludes that his family and peers are trapped in poverty due to their own poor choices and negative attitudes. But I take great exception when he makes statements such as: ‚ÄúWe spend our way into the poorhouse. We buy giant TVs and iPads. Our children wear nice clothes thanks to high-interest credit cards and payday loans. We purchase homes we don‚Äôt need, refinance them for more spending money, and declare bankruptcy. . . . Thrift is inimical to our being.‚Äù

Who is this ‚Äúwe‚Äù of whom he speaks? Vance‚Äôs statements don‚Äôt describe the family in which I grew up, and thy don‚Äôt describe the families I meet who are struggling to make it in America today. I know that my family lived on $6,000 per year because as children, we sat down with pen and paper to help find a way for us to live on that amount. My mom couldn‚Äôt even qualify for a credit card, much less live on credit. She bought our clothes at discount stores.

Thrift was not inimical to our being; it was the very essence of our being.

With lines like ‚ÄúWe choose not to work when we should be looking for jobs,‚Äù Vance‚Äôs sweeping stereotypes are shark bait for conservative policymakers. They feed into the mythology that the undeserving poor make bad choices and are to blame for their own poverty, so taxpayer money should not be wasted on programs to help lift people out of poverty. Now these inaccurate and dangerous generalizations have been made required college reading.

Here is the simple fact: Most poor people work. Seventy-eight percent of families on Medicaid include a household member who is working. People work hard in necessary and important jobs that often don‚Äôt pay them enough to live on. For instance, child-care workers earn an average of $22,930 per year, and home health aides average $23,600. (Indeed, it is a sad irony that crucial jobs around caretaking and children have always paid very little.)

The problem with living in constant economic insecurity is not a lack of thrift, it is that people in these circumstances are always focused on the current crisis. They can‚Äôt plan for the future because they have so much to deal with in the present. And the future seems so bleak that it feels futile to sacrifice for it. What does motivate most people is the belief that the future can be better and that we have a realistic opportunity to achieve it. But sometimes that takes help.

Yes, I worked hard, but I didn‚Äôt just pull myself up by my bootstraps. And neither did Vance. The truth is that people helped us out: My public school‚Äôs guidance counselor encouraged me to go to college.

311,R3I4UNEDG4BHEL,Review from Contrary World blog (the premier source for all things dystopian),"Fahrenheit 451 is one of my all time favorites.  It's written in the third person, placing you into the shoes of an objective narrator who has special access to the thoughts and world view of the characters within the book, especially that of the protagonist. The protagonist (Guy Montag) actually begins the story as a sort of villain really. His profession is that of a future based fireman, who don‚Äôt really put out fires like they used to. In fact, they professionally start fires. What a clever twist on Bradbury‚Äôs part.

These firemen are sanctioned by what one can only conclude to be a dystopian government to burn books, as well as the houses they are contained within. In this future world, the government has deemed books as dangerous, containing ideas that run counter to the narrative they wish to form and broadcast via televisions that cover entire walls within people‚Äôs homes. And the people want this, as they feel more comfortable with their government fed information. How dystopian indeed.

Reminds one of the behavior of the Roman Catholic Church during the Dark Ages. The two have book burning in common, as well as burning Bibles (in the case of the RCC, Bibles that didn‚Äôt subscribe to their criteria ‚Äì even though they came from source material originating from the same authors). No offense to Catholics ‚Äì some Protestant sects weren‚Äôt much better (like the early Anglicans who destroyed much of the Church‚Äôs property, including relics, as did Orthodox Christians during the Iconoclast Era).

Montag takes quite apparent joy in his job, causing a smile to overcome his face every time he gets to burn those devilish books. That is, until he becomes intrigued by a young neighbor girl named Clarisse. Clarisse is a female character that many feminists sadly overlook as to her importance in the overall arc of the story. Good on Bradbury for taking this approach, as you know what they say ‚Äì ‚Äúbehind every great man, there‚Äôs an even greater woman‚Äù. This doesn‚Äôt always have to imply a spouse, mind you, and Bradbury exploited this fact while using Montag‚Äôs lame wife as a great contrast.

Clarisse is somehow able to tap into Montag‚Äôs emotional capacity to better understand what exactly his job is harming, and how his otherwise dull life (including dull wife who serves as a great example of the brainwashed zombie like people of his society) could become so much more enriched by. This confrontation with not only Clarisse ‚Äì but himself ‚Äì causes a sort of psychosis for our villainous protagonist. And thus begins his character development that makes the book really begin to take off and hook the reader into the protagonist‚Äôs story arc and growth.

At first, Montag struggles with his newfound understanding of the profound beauty of books. He is intrigued by the sense of wonder, emotion, and timelessness that books have to offer compared to the mind numbing talking heads that rule the day (sounds similar to our times with all the political talking heads telling how people should think, unlike books that allow people to draw their own conclusions). Yet he is still skeptical, resisting this newfound understanding as he continues in his line of work.

He challenges the notion of books being a net positive for society along the way, including challenging protectors of books along the way. All of this amidst some unknown war going on in the background of the story that is never really described in much detail. I assume that Bradbury himself had assumed (living in the days of the Cold War between the US and the USSR) that some kind of war of that magnitude coming to fruition was sadly somewhat inevitable.

As his change of heart is occurring, he struggles with his chief named Beatty (the antagonist of the story). Beatty is a walking contradiction, as he is full of knowledge pertaining to the books they burn. He is so well versed in their content by heart, yet seeks to eliminate books from existence on behalf of the government.

Unlike Montag who simply found pleasure in his destructive line of work, Beatty knows full well every reason and intention as to why they do and takes pleasure in doing so. This, all while being so well versed in the knowledge and insights contained within them. He overall sees them as dangerous, yet behaves as if the type of knowledge contained within books should be reserved for elites rather than the average citizen. This antagonist displays the kind of pretentious attitude that perfectly captures what it means to convey the notion of a dystopian society within a book of this genre.

After trials and tribulations in his struggle, Montag reaches a point where he is so moved by the message of a particular book, that he even steals it so that he can preserve it himself. As a Christian myself, I personally loved that this book just so happened to be a Bible. Why does Montag take such a personal infatuation with the Bible?

It may be that Montag‚Äôs society is so lost that when bombs begin to fall toward the end, whatever Montag had read might help him and others rebuild society for the better. After all, the Bible is full of advice, and provides direction for moral and ethical enrichment. Certainly a new society would need guidelines to rebuild and improve over mistakes made in the past.

Montag refers to the book of Job at one point in the story, as well as references made about Caanan. At the end, Montag even tries to recall parts of the books of Ecclesiastes and Revelation. The book of Revelation itself (arguably my favorite book of the Bible ‚Äì I‚Äôm a fan of the dystopian genre after all) deals with the end of times. Although, perhaps Montag failed to recall this as quickly as he might because they are preparing to start a new life when the world appears to be ending.

The novel ends with Montag escaping the city in the midst of this new war. He escapes deep into the countryside, meeting a band of roving intellectuals who have elected to preserve significant works of literature in their memory. Reminds me of the Vaudois, the Waldenses and the Albigenses who preserved the original books of scripture in spite of the persecution they suffered from the RCC.

Not long after these roving intellectuals welcome Montag into their community, an atomic bomb falls on the city and reduces it to rubble. The next morning Montag leads the men on foot back toward the city with rebuilding in mind. The novel‚Äôs conclusion functions to bring the prevalent violence to its logical conclusion, which is that violence infiltrates nearly every aspect of the world our protagonist finds himself in.

The firemen violently destroy people‚Äôs property and lives. Television displays gruesome, desensitizing violence for viewers‚Äô entertainment. Pedestrians regularly get trampled by speeding vehicles. Finally, war takes these forms of violence to a new extreme, destroying society and its infrastructure altogether. The novel‚Äôs ending depicts the inevitable self-destruction of such an oppressive society in such an effective, and rather melancholy fashion.

As stated in the beginning of the Fahrenheit 451 book review, this book is one of my all time favorites. It‚Äôs no wonder as to why I give it a 5/5 rating. Bradbury‚Äôs use of language is lyrical, yet not overly forceful. He paints a picture of a world in which we as a society should wish to avoid ‚Äì in a multifaceted way.

When it comes to dystopian books, this is truly a classic ‚Äì and for good reason. Not only was it tremendous back in its heyday; it has stood the test of time, proving to be of use to us nearly 70 years later. I absolutely love Fahrenheit 451, and I believe you would too if you love dystopian fiction and have happened to somehow not have read it yet (it happens ‚Äì later is better than never though!).",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3I4UNEDG4BHEL,Kevin Walrath,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2021",True,95 people found this helpful,1451673310,,,

313,R3BSMNM88LZ46,Fahrenheit 451,"Fahrenheit 451, was written by Ray Bradbury, and won the National Book Award. In this book, literature is forbidden and it is the job of the well respected firemen to destroy them and the houses in which they are hidden. This story gives you a sense of uncertainty, and has many plot twists. It is written in the perspective of an experienced fireman, Montag, who takes pleasure in seeing the houses and books be engulfed by orange flames. But a series of unexpected events lead him to question his past and even begins breaking the law himself.
This story is set in the future, where the government has forbid literature in hopes to repress everyone‚Äôs thoughts and knowledge. Technology is advancing quickly and everyone needs to have the latest; entire walls made of one television screen. Hours upon hours are spent with the television ‚Äúfamilies.‚Äù The few who have any sense are seen as odd and deemed as outcasts.
Montag begins as a typical fireman. He just follows the rules and goes on with his life, unmindful of what is happening in the world. Much like everyone else in the society. As the story progresses, he becomes more of a risk-taker. He starts to act for himself instead of for the good of society. Montag‚Äôs wife, Mildred, on the other hand, stays consistent with her characteristics throughout the story. She is more of a selfish, person who has been brainwashed by television. Mildred is an unpredictable character who seems to be in high spirits, but she tries to commit suicide, by eating too many sleeping pills.
From the beginning of the story, you can tell that something is different in their society, as firemen burn down houses rather than put out fires. A significant event occurs right off the bat when Montag meets Clarisse, a young insightful girl who opens Montag‚Äôs eyes to the past when books were legal and people didn‚Äôt spend all of their time in front of the television screen. Clarisse meets Montag everyday in the same spot, on his way to and from work. They converse about the past and to Montag, she seems so wise and he immediately befriends her. After awhile Montag‚Äôs life begins to change, he doesn‚Äôt seem to know his wife anymore and he begins to doubt his all his previous knowledge. Pretty soon, Montag and Clarisse‚Äôs meetings become routine. But suddenly Clarisse wasn‚Äôt there to greet him on his way home anymore. She had disappeared and her whole family was gone. Montag and his wife are growing further and further apart. After the unexpected disappearance of Clarisse, Montag begins hiding books in his own home, hoping that they will help him to know what to do next.
After a session with the fire captain, Beatty, Montag realizes why books were forbidden, simply to ensure that no one would be smarter than anyone else. The government anticipated that in banning books, it would repress everyone‚Äôs thoughts and ideas, so no one would be too smart. And they hoped to let technology pretty much brainwash people into believing that literature is not worth their time. So, by letting technology be dominant over literature, one will lose their knowledge. And the government‚Äôs plan worked, they‚Äôve created dumbed-down, technologically crazed clones.
 Montag refused to go to work for quite some time, but upon returning he made a new ally. Faber, a wise, old criminal, and Montag were fed up with the laws against books. The allies wanted to form a plan to rebel and legalize books again. They intended on planting books in firemen‚Äôs‚Äô houses and then call the alarm. Montag knew their plan was risky and that if caught; he would surely go to prison and maybe be put to death. Before he and Faber even began to fulfill their plan, they encountered an unforeseen delay. While Montag was at work one day, the firemen got a call for a fire, nothing out of the unusual, but when they arrived at the house it was Montag‚Äôs own house. Mildred had turned him in. Because Montag was now a criminal, he has to go on the run. Meanwhile, war has broken out in the community. I‚Äôll let you see for yourself how it ends.
This book, because of the extensive detail, can be a little confusing at times. I would recommend it for older people. But, it‚Äôs very well written and I enjoyed reading it. It leaves you fearing a world with evolving technology and no literature.  I believe that anyone looking for a fiction, dystopian novel, would take pleasure in reading this book as I did.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3BSMNM88LZ46,Shannon Garcia,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on December 16, 2013",True,8 people found this helpful,1451673310,,,

315,RMW0KTGHM6GQH,The Temperature at Which Books Burn,"SOME SPOILERS (as if no one had read ""Fahrenheit 451"" before I finally did):

The lateness of the review does not reveal my opinion of this novel. That being said, I can see why some folks raise their eyebrows at the thought of high-school kids reading this.
""Fahrenheit 451"" is a classic -- and a highly-banned book -- for a reason: it is simply stellar at making its point: the world needs to preserve the great thoughts of history, even if it is ""only"" in people's heads, not in physical books. We need people to think big thoughts, to address the thorny problems, and also just simply to write beautiful words. Mr. Bradbury honestly does both in this disturbing read. I honestly wasn't sure I should be reading it at bedtime, b/c of Mr. Bradbury's graphic writing. The introduction to Clarisse McClellan -- and her quick departure from the storyline -- was upsetting and senseless. Guy sees this, and this revelation changes his views of everything: his job, his marriage, his wife's ""addiction"" to the banality of her screens on every wall. What disturbed me the worst, however, was his wife's overdose and the extremely mundane, all-in-a-day's-work, attitude of her rescuers.
What a sad world! Books are burned and overdoses are so commonplace that there are rescue teams going about all night long ""saving"" people. I'm glad that we don't live in this world -- yet.
Let me end w/ an example of Mr. Bradbury's excellent writing in the FIRST paragraph of this view of a dystopian future:
""It was a pleasure to burn.
It was a special pleasure to see things eaten, to see things blackened and CHANGED [caps b/c I don't know how to italicize]. With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history."" p. 1.

I mean, wow, just ... wow.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMW0KTGHM6GQH,Sherry Sharpnack,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2024",True,5 people found this helpful,1451673310,,,
316,R2KAQPGOIRR40C,Great dystopian novel!,"This book is set in a future society (through the lens of the American 1950‚Äôs) where a fireman‚Äôs job is not to stop fires, but to start them. We follow our protagonist, Guy Montag, as he contentedly goes to work everyday and burns books. Sometimes, if there are many books, he and his fellow fireman burn the entire house down, and they do it without question. One day, that question is posed by an eccentric young girl named Clarisse, who challenges Guy‚Äôs notions of why he lives the way that he does. He begins to realize that everything in his life is censored to keep him from thinking. The reasoning is ostensibly that hard and difficult thoughts and ideas (like those held in books) make people unhappy, as it forces them to think. As an added example, his wife spends all day at home with her ‚Äúfamily,‚Äù which is really just a wall of televisions that keep her entertained and thus unthinking. I found it poignant that even in the early 50‚Äôs, television had been identified as a tool for media barons to spread mass influence, especially when you consider the addiction that television and media has become in today‚Äôs age. So, Guy pushes back against the system in control (by reading a book) and he is subsequently pursued as an outsider. His life is turned upside down, he flees, and by the end of our story, he finds himself amongst the rebels. These ‚Äúrebels‚Äù are former college professors and intellectual thinkers who have been cast out of the system and now live in the forest as homeless men. Their mission in life, and how they show their resistance, is by remembering. They remember the knowledge of old, things that used to be held in books, and their hope is to someday bring humanity‚Äôs collective intelligence back to the forefront of society.

What I really liked about this book was the thought put into the characters. Sure, Guy is your average guy, as his name suggests, and his wife is cast as the sucker of the system, refusing to be enlightened and instead choosing to live in blissful ignorance (at one point in the book, Guy is raising his concerns about not being happy in their shallow lives, and his wife responds ‚ÄúI‚Äôm tired of listening to this junk‚Äù and promptly turns from Guy back to her television program.) But I found it impressively accurate that the initial crack in the facade came from youth. At a certain age, people seem to come to a form of societal acceptance, and I loved that it was essentially a child who came along and finally asked the all important question: ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù It made me wonder, what do we adults lose by forgoing our ability to continually ask this question, both of ourselves and the world around us?

Another character I liked was the fire captain Beatty. Every dystopian novel needs an antagonist and this is Beatty‚Äôs role. However, while it makes sense that the haggard professors comprise the resistance, Beatty is also an educated man having read many pieces of literature and views the information in books in an opposing light. He has found them to be endlessly contradictory, and thusly tools of unhappiness, and has found comfort in his mission to destroy them. I found it fascinating that the author showed learned characters who, when presented with the same world-choices, made opposing decisions. I think it really goes to show the differing wisdoms of individual people. Two people can read the same book, and while one can love it and the other hate it, both can be correct, because it is (in most cases) a subjective medium.

Now, framed as the antagonist, some might say that Beatty took the ‚Äòeasy‚Äô way out. But would it also be appropriate to suggest that in a world overflowing with chaos, he accepted the path of least resistance? Would there be merit in a condemnation of his choice, or should we opt for mercy? Or neither, and should we, as both readers of fiction and also members of our current society, accept his decision and the reasons behind it? I don‚Äôt have answers to these questions, and I think it wise not to try and decide. Instead, I think we should all periodically ponder them, especially as we find ourselves making similar decisions in our own lives, and watch others close to us do the same. Society doesn‚Äôt move forward when we force our opinions onto other. True merit is born of the perpetual quest for understanding and always asking why?",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KAQPGOIRR40C,Cody Allen,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/7105437c-3947-4583-90d1-ff6d0d9b79f9._CR0,0,490,490_SX48_.jpg",['https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81M5AQ-RSVL._SY88.jpg'],,"Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2020",True,64 people found this helpful,1451673310,,,

319,RF42PPHOD6PS6,Did not like the novel.,"It is apparently agreed that the main theme of this novel, ""Fahrenheit 451"" by Ray Bradbury, is that the censorship and physical elimination of books will lead to a dystopian nightmare.

But this is NOT the main theme of this novel. The main theme is given on page 104: Faber says to montag: ""But remember that the Captain [fire Captain Beatty] belongs to the most dangerous enemy to truth and freedom, the solid unmoving cattle of the majority. Oh, God, the terrible tyranny of the majority.""

The main theme: the majority of people are so defective, stupid, callous, incurious, gullible, envious, etc that democracy (rule buy the people) cannot succeed and must lead to a hyper-conformist, totalitarian, ultra-repressive dystopian nightmare.

Faber dehumanizes the majority of people as ""cattle"" and the ""enemy."" There have been many terrible examples of where this kind of dehumanization can lead.

This theme reverberates throughout the entire novel. Surprisingly this nightmare society is a democracy. The authorities in Montag's city regularly hold free elections, and the people can vote for anyone they want to. The elected officials do everything they can to gratify the desires of the voting public. And so this results in the nightmare described.

The novel describes the voters (p.93) as too stupid and superficial to make an informed decision as to whom to vote for.

Montag's city is destroyed in just a couple seconds because the regime is frequently going to war and without any public debate at all. Why? Because the people do not want to debate these or any issues. It wants the regime to make the decisions for them.

Fire Captain Beatty explains to Montag (p.56) that people ""live for"" and just want to have ""fun,"" ""pleasure,"" ""titillation,"" and to be ""happy."" And so the democratic regime provides these to the people. Beatty apparently believes that people (or the majority of) do not seek meaning, but only fun & pleasure. This is of course not true.

The novel presents a misanthropic point of view. It consistently describes the ""common"" people as stupid, violent, envious, callous, incurious, gullible, superficial, etc who want other people (the politicians) to make decisions for them.

The novel says that the ""answer"" lies in getting rid of democracy and instituting an aristocracy (a government or state ruled by an aristocracy, an elite, or a privileged upper class). It's not a coincidence that Granger is ""Plato's Republic"" (p.144), a work that describes the ideal society as rigidly hierarchal and ruled by a philosopher-king. Plato hated democracy and felt it led to tyranny, and the novel shares these views. They permeate the entire novel.

The novel postulates that sometime between the 1950s, when this novel first appeared, and 2049 CE, when it is apparently set, the people of the United States will voluntarily and democratically decide to institute the horrible nightmare dystopia described. Did this prediction come true ? No. There are 25 years left, but is seems unlikely.

The novel is a very emotional (indeed hysterical) screed against democracy and the people and for the belief that only an aristocracy can save them. The novel is enormously tendentious.

The novel never precisely explains how this nightmare scenario emerges. It gives clues. Among other causes, Beatty blames ""minorities"" (p. 54-57). He says that they complained about being discriminated against and portrayed negatively. Beatty apparently wants ""minorities"" to just shut up.

Beatty (p.55) explains the public wanted books eliminated, so the democratic government got rid of them.

Faber (p.83) explains to Montag: ""The public itself stopped reading of its own accord."" Does this seem at all likely ? No. Just more of the novel's ever-present misanthropy and bias.

Clarisse (p.27-28) endorses spanking children. She explains: ""They [earlier generations] believed in responsibility, my uncle says. Do you know, I'm responsible. I was spanked when I needed it, years ago. And I do all the shopping and housecleaning by hand."" The novel endorses a gendered division of labor. Does spanking children lead to ""responsibility"" ? It seems unlikely. The novel apparently believes that technology gives ordinary people too much free time to think which they can't productively use because they are defective.

Beatty (p.51) explains that increasing population size inevitably means the intellectual infantilization of the entire society. Is this true ? I don't see why it would be.

Montag (in the scene between himself and his wife's friends) wants important issues to be discussed and questions to be asked (p.92-98), but he only wants some questions to be asked and only his preferred ""answers"" to be given. That Montag reads ""Dover Beach"" by Matthew Arnold to these women is not a coincidence. Montag clearly believes that a lessening of religiosity and increasing secularism are the signposts of a degenerate society and will lead to disaster. Has this disaster happened ? No.

Near the end of the novel (p.151-153), Montag's city (the novel portrays cities negatively) is destroyed by enemy bombing. This is the novel's view of the inevitable result of allowing ""the majority"" to rule.

Granger (""Plato's Republic"") says (p.150-151) to Montag: ""Ask no guarantees, ask for no security, there never was such an animal."" He says that anyone getting, wanting ""security"" would be a ""sloth,"" ""sleeping its life away."" Clearly he is a Libertarian. Is it true that, when people have ""security,"" they ""sleep"" their lives away ? No. it's not.

The political stances of the novel are consistent throughout: the endorsement of aristocracy, authoritarianism, elitism, misanthropy, hostility to democracy, etc. And conservatism, elitism, authoritarianism, aristocracy, hierarchy as the ""answer,"" ""solution"" to the democratic dystopian nightmare presented.

A right-wing conservative reading this novel would find nothing to complain about. Some people say this novel is ""satire."" Clearly some parts of the book are satirical, but others aren't.

I'm not saying that people shouldn't read this novel, but they should be aware that the burning, censoring of books is NOT the main theme. It's surprising that a novel that expresses such bad political, social, philosophical ideas should become a science-fiction ""classic.""

A person could write an entire book on the bad ideas in this novel.

The novel seems to be expressing the view that liberalism is a ""threat"" to ""truth"" and ""freedom,"" and this ""threat"" is the main theme of this novel.",1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RF42PPHOD6PS6,Paul Couillard,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on August 14, 2024",True,36 people found this helpful,1451673310,,,
320,R2ZT5WQ42NG5T6,Definitely makes you think.,"Fahrenheit 451 is set in a world where books have been outlawed. The tale revolves around Guy Montag, a fireman, who in this world are tasked with burning books and starting fires in place of putting them out. After meeting a fascinating teenager called Clarisse he is introduced to a new way of thinking, one that changes his entire view of the world.

I am embarrassed to admit that until recently I had never heard of Fahrenheit 451, although I had heard of the author Ray Bradbury before. How I discovered this novel was after reading and thoroughly enjoying Reader of Acheron by Walter Rhein. I noticed in several of the reviews for the Reader of Acheron how favorably Walter Rhein‚Äôs novel was being compared to Fahrenheit 451. The main reason why I bring this up is because if it hadn‚Äôt been for the Internet or Amazon, where I could read such reviews at a moment‚Äôs whim I never would have discovered this book. In other words I discovered Fahrenheit 451 because of the advancements in technology we enjoy today.

This is interesting to me because Fahrenheit 451 deals with the dangers of technology or rather the dangers of over reliance of technology. It is amazing to me how some of the points made in a book written over 50 years ago are still relevant today. I remember reading the part where a seashell radio is introduced and in my head it looked exactly like a blue tooth earpiece. Another part where Guy is talking to his wife about putting in a 4th TV wall instantly conjured up images of the How I Met Your Mother episode, where Lily discovers that one of Barney‚Äôs walls is actually a television.

But this also lead me to thinking about the cast of characters in How I Met Your Mother and I realized, all the characters were well read. Marshall was a lawyer and so by default had to spend years with his head in a book in order to pass the bar. Ted was an architect and often showed affection for classic novels and poems. Lily was a schoolteacher, you have to be well read by default for that occupation, the same goes for the journalist Robin. Barney clearly enjoyed reading, he wrote the Bro Code and the Playbook. I mean sure they may not have been great literary works, but clearly he valued the power of books.

Okay so why have I spent a paragraph talking about How I Met Your Mother on a review for this book? Because this book came out decades before I was born, I didn‚Äôt grow up in the 50‚Äôs or the 60‚Äôs and therefore have never really experienced what the world was like back then. I only have the modern day to compare ‚Äúthe future‚Äù that this book represents. Haven‚Äôt we all watched a sci-fi movie born out of the 70‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs, ones that represent those decades‚Äô vision of what the 2000‚Äôs were going to be like? Haven‚Äôt we at times shook our heads at some of the claims that were made now decades ago?

Well I didn‚Äôt shake my head at most of the predications that Ray Bradbury made and to me that was a little startling. I mean yes you can nit pick the small pieces that show it is a product of its time, such as the fact there were no employed women or that wages were criminally low (by today‚Äôs standard). But just the notion that this decades‚Äô old story still has specific relevance today is quite impressive.

But what really made this story for me was a certain revelation that occurred three-fifths into the book. Basically Guy Montag is talking to a former professor about why books are considered so dangerous in this world and why they were burned. The reason is more than simply the information that the books hold, it also has to do with the necessity of books. Sad to say in the most practical of terms a person can live without a book, it can be done with the wonders of technology. But how many people in this day and age can live without their mobile phone? Their tablet? The Internet?

While of course Bradbury had no way of knowing about these specific advances his point is made clear. You can turn off a television, a computer, a radio, a phone, but you can‚Äôt turn off a book. Once you have sat down and read it, there‚Äôs no way of turning it off, even if you close the book the information is in your mind, those once written words have become thought. That is why books were banned, because they couldn‚Äôt be controlled with a flick of a switch and therefore were considered dangerous, because there was no guarantee that all those thoughts would be happy or pleasant ones. The consequences for Fahrenheit 451‚Äôs world are that it may be a world of safety, of practicality but of rare beauty. With no reason to think for one‚Äôs self, to question why things are the way they are, to explore those shades of gray, there is nothing to dream about.

I cannot think of a more beautiful way to describe the greatness of books, I had never in my whole life thought about it like that. When I had read that part of the story all of my argumentative notions about technology being solely responsible for people not reading were wiped away. Look, I don‚Äôt know if that was the author‚Äôs intent, to catch the reader off guard like that, but frankly I don‚Äôt care, because to me the way that point was made and built towards was absolutely brilliant.

Yes it still deals with being weary about the wonders of technology and yes that is a theme that all classic sci-fi deals with. But Fahrenheit 451 IS a classic novel and after having read it I can see why. I know now why this is still read in schools, I know now why it is still considered relevant. It got me thinking, it made me want to discuss the implications it made. But most importantly it made me aware of the power of choice.

Technology was never the sole culprit, as I said in the first paragraph of this review, I discovered this book because of technology, heck I am reading it on an e-reader! The problem was that people willingly closed themselves off to different ways of thinking, all in the name of severe ‚Äúsafety‚Äù and it showed me the dangers of doing that. But the most important part of all of this for me was that I CHOSE to read it, I forgot about my prior connotations regarding this book and because of that I have a way of looking at things that frankly I didn‚Äôt before. Fahrenheit 451 taught me a valuable life lesson and to me that shows why this book deserves to be considered a classic.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZT5WQ42NG5T6,immaree,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on March 18, 2014",True,22 people found this helpful,1451673310,,,

323,RMLDQF0NV6PZO,"An incredibly moving story, we can't wait for a sequel!","A review from my 10 year old:
This book is about a robot named Roz, short for Rozzum, a robot that was supposed to be transported to a factory but the ship was sadly sunken and she was washed up on a island. She had to learn to survive in a place that a robot would never be in. And she finds many different techniques to do so. The robot goes on many exciting adventures and gets lots of friends that you might not expect including her own adopted son who happens to be a duck named Brightbill whose family was crushed by an avalanche. She was living a happy life until her creators find out where she is and don't like that she is living in the forest.
 I think this book is about the interaction between nature and technology. On his blog Peter Brown wrote, ‚ÄúBack in 2008, while working on a picture book called The Curious Garden‚Ä¶ I loved imagining scenes of nature living in surprising places. And that got me thinking about scenes of unnatural things living in surprising places‚Äù ([...]). The robot is a piece of technology but she can learn to live in the wild which makes me think that one of the meanings of this book is that people today can still stop pollution and destruction of the natural world. I also think that the author was trying to tell the readers that no matter who you are you can do anything. The robot was having trouble in the forest at first but she started to learn and get better by watching animals. I also think that the book is about not giving up. Even after all the animals were scared of her Roz kept trying to be friendly and finally became friends with all the animals.
 One amazing thing about this book is the artwork witch makes sense because Peter Brown was an artist before he was a writer. Another thing that I liked about this book is that it makes me feel sad but gave me hope that things will get better. The third thing that makes this book unique is that  it has very creative ideas. In one of the scenes in the book Roz loses her foot to a bear and then cant walk. And then she asked the beavers to make her a new one out of wood. That is one of the many creative scenes in the book.
 This book was very good in my opinion. It was one of my favorite books I've ever read and i would very much recommend it. This book is creative, well written, and interesting. I think that it is a great book and think its definitely worth reading. I don't want to give away the ending but is very dramatic and emotional. Roz has to draw on all of her friendships and skills she has learned from them to survive.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMLDQF0NV6PZO,Casey Du√©,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on August 4, 2016",True,22 people found this helpful,0316382000,,,

326,RP2LIU0EAVV2J,Possible Triggers,"There will be spoilers!

This is the review I wish I had read before purchasing this book. I saw this book all over instagram and youtube. Everyone was recommending it - especially my favorite Homeschool Mom Influencers. I bought it simply because of that and didn't even read a real review. Boy, I wish I had. I wish I had known some of the themes so I could have made a more informed decision.

On the surface this seems like a cute nature story that has a robot. Sounds fun, right? Well, it is until it isn't. So many things came up in this book that honestly surprised me for a children's chapter book. There was bullying, murder (yes murder), adoption, found family, death, fire, dismemberment, guns, and likely more. I was not prepared.

The format was a little different but not necessarily bad. The book had a ton of mini chapters. Most were only a page or two and hardly any were more than that. That made it an easy book as far as reading it aloud to kids. Roz the main character was likeable. If you take the time to read her dialog in a robot voice your kids will love it. I gave this book 4 stars because my kids liked it and asked to continue the series. I just wish I had known a bit more before I picked it and I am thankful I read it aloud rather than handing it off because of the content. Even though it includes things like accidental murder, there is remorse. It just came as a shock for a kids book.

So, insights into how to think and behave about money is instructive.

You may think you don‚Äôt have enough money to make a difference for your future. I think this book will show you, how even with those thoughts, that you can.

Chocked full of great insights to guide us all.

Quotes that hit home from various chapters are presented below. There are many more quotes possible, but then you‚Äôd miss the message between each quote. I strongly suggest getting the book to see how these below snippets string together into a powerful story about how we think and behave towards money matters.

Quote:
‚Ä¢ Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what‚Äôs happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.
‚Ä¢ Luck and risk are siblings.
‚Ä¢ Yes, but I have something he will never have ‚Ä¶ enough.
‚Ä¢ There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you don‚Äôt have and don‚Äôt need.
‚Ä¢ The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.
‚Ä¢ $81.5 billion of Warren Buffett‚Äôs $84.5 billion net worth came after his 65th birthday.
‚Ä¢ Buffett began serious investing when he was 10 years old.
‚Ä¢ His skill is investing, but his secret is time. That‚Äôs how compounding works.
‚Ä¢ But good investing isn‚Äôt necessarily about earning the highest returns, because the highest returns tend to be one-off hits that can‚Äôt be repeated. It‚Äôs about earning pretty good returns that you can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest period of time. That‚Äôs when compounding runs wild.
‚Ä¢ Getting wealthy vs. staying wealthy.
‚Ä¢ Getting money is one thing. Keeping it is another.
‚Ä¢ Planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan.
‚Ä¢ No one is impressed with your possessions as much as you are.
‚Ä¢ When you see someone driving a nice car, you rarely think, ‚ÄúWow, the guy driving that car is cool.‚Äù Instead, you think, ‚ÄúWow, if I had that car people would think I‚Äôm cool.‚Äù
‚Ä¢ Humility, kindness, and empathy will bring you more respect than horsepower ever will.
‚Ä¢ Spending money to show people how much money you have is the fastest way to have less money.
‚Ä¢ Money has many ironies. Here‚Äôs an important one: Wealth is what you don‚Äôt see.
‚Ä¢ Past a certain level of income people fall into three groups: Those who save, those who don‚Äôt think they can save, and those who don‚Äôt think they need to save.
‚Ä¢ Building wealth has little to do with your income or investment returns, and lots to do with your savings rate.
‚Ä¢ The value of wealth is relative to what you need.
‚Ä¢ Past a certain level of income, what you need is just what sits below your ego.
‚Ä¢ People‚Äôs ability to save is more in their control than they might think.
‚Ä¢ Things that have never happened before happen all the time.
‚Ä¢ The thing that makes tail events easy to underappreciate is how easy it is to underestimate how things compound. How, for example, 9/11 prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, which helped drive the housing bubble, which led to the financial crisis, which led to a poor jobs market, which led to tens of millions to seek a college education, which led to [over a trillion dollars] in student loans with [a high percentage of default rates].
‚Ä¢ The correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world is surprising.
‚Ä¢ The most important part of every plan is planning on your plan not going according to plan.
‚Ä¢ The purpose of the margin of safety is to render the forecast unnecessary.
‚Ä¢ The End of History Illusion is what psychologists call the tendency for people to be keenly aware of how much they‚Äôve changed in the past, but to underestimate how much their personalities, desires and goals are likely to change in the future. [Thus, their history of change won‚Äôt change anymore into their future].
‚Ä¢ Every job looks easy when you‚Äôre not the one doing it.
‚Ä¢ Successful investing looks easy when you‚Äôre not the one doing it. Hold stocks for the long run ‚Ä¶ but do you know how hard it is to maintain a long-term outlook when stocks are collapsing?
‚Ä¢ Price ‚Ä¶ not dollars and cents ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs volatility, fear, doubt, uncertainty ‚Ä¶ all of which are easy to overlook until you‚Äôre dealing with them in real time.
‚Ä¢ Beware of taking financial cues from people playing a different game than you are.
‚Ä¢ When investors have different goals and time horizons ‚Äì and they do in every asset class ‚Äì prices that look ridiculous to one person can make sense to another, because the factors those investors pay attention to are different.
‚Ä¢ The interesting thing about [absolutely pessimistic] stories is that their polar opposite ‚Äì forecasts of outrageous optimism ‚Äì are rarely taken as seriously as prophets of doom.
‚Ä¢ Pessimism just sounds smarter and more plausible than optimism.
‚Ä¢ ‚Ä¶progress happens too slowly to notice, but setbacks happen too quickly to ignore.
‚Ä¢ The more you want something to be true, the more likely you are to believe a story that overestimates the odds of it being true.
‚Ä¢ We don‚Äôt know what we don‚Äôt know.
‚Ä¢ Coming to terms with how much you don‚Äôt know means coming to terms with how much of what happens in the world is out of your control. And that can be hard to accept.
‚Ä¢ Less ego, more wealth.
‚Ä¢ If you want to to do better as an investor, the single most powerful thing you can do is increase your time horizon.

335,R2RS1SLQ3QLUTW,Very very good.,"My background: financially unhealthy, controlling and financially abusive (by definition, not my diagnosis) upbringing.
SO background: one parent financially astute but not at all risky and one who is a spending addict.

This books seems mis-labeled to me. It is using the premise of finances and money as examples, but the focus is human psychology and what drives individuals. There is some study on financial habits of the financially successful. But overall, it is a study on human behavior and why we risk, what we risk versus why and what we stay safely away from risk.

The books has been helpful in that I have had to deal with and work through my issues with money, trust issues with people and shedding some light into why it might be people do what they do.

This books reminds me of 'How to Win Friends and Influence people,' in many ways. It is not like 'Rich Dad Poor Dad.'

Morgan Housel does an excellent job explaining why people risk what they do, and also don't.

Having completed a chapter 7 Bankruptcy in 2018 to buying a house (second starter home) in 2021... I hope to continue improving my personal financial world, and that of the world around me, for the sake of my kids and any future generations. This book does an excellent job continuing that education, and also my education in the psychology of humanity.

Frankly, I can't say enough about the book. It's a good beach read, bored out of my mind read, need some challenge read, airplane read... whatever. Sitting at your desk or cubicle and need to preoccupy myself read.

I will be adding a hardcover to my library. This would be a fantastic gift to those who have an interest in psychology or finances. Or anyone just interested in better understanding humanity. Frankly, it takes the glam out of ""glamour"" for me.

The author humanized people. He doesn't set them on a pedestal. He explains what they have done from a functional financial standpoint and then distinguishes that success is objective... or maybe that's just my takeaway?
Regardless, this book has certainly caused me to ""Go home and rethink my life.""

I highly, highly recommend it.

~ Editing is phenomenal! I haven't found a spelling or grammar mistake yet *starts screaming like a little girl*.

The chapter titles are attention grabbers to get our attention to read more. But the most important thing to learn from this book is ""Margin of Safety"".

According to the author, it is one of the most underappreciated forces in finance. It comes in many forms: a frugal budget, flexible thinking, and a loose time line - anything that lets you live happily with a range of outcomes. Controlling your time is the highest dividend money pays.

The book is pretty much evolved around the concept of ""Margin of Safety."" It encourages readers to save money and not spending money lavishly. The key is staying wealthy and not just getting wealthy. We can't be complacent and assume that yesterday's success translate into tomorrow's good fortune. Wealth is what you don't see. Spending money to show people how much money you have is the fastest way to have less money.

Good investing is not about getting the highest returns. It's about getting good returns that you can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest period of time. According to the author, the historial odds of making money in US markets are 50/50 over one-day periods, 68% in one-year periods, 88% in 10 -year periods and (sofar) 100% in 20-year periods.

Forecasting is hard. This is why invetsment guru Benjamin Graham is a strong advocate for margin of safety as the purpose of margin of safety is to render the forecast unnecessary. The author cited the success rate of venture financing from 20024 to 2014: 65% lost money, 2.5% of invetsments made 10X to 20X, 1% made more than 20X return, only 1/2% (~100 companies) earn 50X or more.

According to George Soros, it is not whether you are right or wrong that's important but how much money you made when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong. You can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune.

The most interesting part of the book is the last chapter: Postcript. Thanks to the internet, the world is more connected than ever. What that means is the talent pool the readers compete with has gone from 100s or 1000s sprang their towns to  millions or billions spanning the globe.

 The author ended the book with a not so pessimistic note. The era of ""this isn't working"" may stick around. And the era of ""We need something radically new, right now, whatever it is"" may stick around.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQ64LJY8AYO3Q,Desmond Yuen,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/afc19726-9c18-4520-9756-decd3de18fc5._CR0,0,337,337_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on February 25, 2024",True,87 people found this helpful,B08D9WJ9G8,,,

339,R30TAIVAFIZBC8,A Significant and Badly Needed Contribution to the Qualitative Part of our Financial Life.,"From the first sentence to the last, this book provides the latest and most up-to-date evidence for financial literacy's wholesome power to enrich your entire life. The author tells stories to discover financial literacy and living a good life go hand and hand. Most financial books discuss the dominated and respected quantitative side, the sophisticated science, complicated formulas, and mind-numbing statistics. Reading the traditional personal finance genres makes people erroneously think investors need to be intelligent and aggressive to invest successfully.

The Psychology of Money is courageously different. It is about life first and finances second. Don‚Äôt we want to better understand our behavior, our sense of ourselves and what makes us tick so we can achieve that vibrant and contented life? I know I do.

The author skillfully separates the easy part of discovering the investing process versus the hard part. This may shock newbies, but understanding the quantitative aspect of finances, such as constructing a diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds, is the easy part. Look, it is not the little guy or gal versus the massively intimating stock market with the macho goal of beating the average returns. Instead, this book is about understanding our behavior and the decisions we make to achieve a balanced and calm life with accepting reasonable stock market returns. Now that‚Äôs the hard part! But this author makes understanding our behavior achievable and interesting. He accepts whatever skills, experience, or knowledge readers bring to the table.

The author brings up an age-old adage that we have been taught by our elders for generations‚Äîdon‚Äôt take things so personally! With life's many challenges and sometimes negative surprises, isn't it about how we react that counts? Instead, if we respond with wisdom gained from our experiences over the long haul, the challenge itself will eventually be insignificant.

The author explains that our reactive behavior, whether the sudden death of a loved one, a broken water pipe damaging our house, or a stock market crash, how we respond to each of these vastly different crises is no different. As a reviewer of this outstanding book, I took the liberty of interpreting the primary theme with my examples. With the death of a loved one, we can blame the doctors, the hospital, and isolate from friends and family, and sob over beers for the rest of your life as a lonely and bitter widow or widower, or you can blame the stock market, your broker, or valueless Wall Street for your portfolio loses. For example, it is well known that millions of investors reacted negatively for over a decade. They sat out with their two to three trillion of the longest bull market in history because they lost money in the 2008 financial crisis. So, no matter what the experience, isn't it always how we react? This book would help those unfortunate investors pull themselves and their portfolio together to get back in the market.

To bring mindfulness to our reactions, the author talked about investors' emotions, attitude, and temperament. To be successful in this counterintuitive financial system is to be aware and insightful of this powerful psychological human potential‚Äîyour expectation of future returns. The Goldilocks Principle doesn't have too high return expectations or too low, but somewhere in between. But what is a reasonable expected return?

The author reports one of the most significant FACTS of the entire book: The United States Stock Market Returns 6.8% after Inflation. Allow me to repeat, 6.8%.

According to the author, our United States capitalistic system produces about 6.8% return minus inflation since the 1870s (3.1% average inflation generates a total return of 9.9%). It is the law of averages, and it is powerful if we know how to tap into it and to be 100% satisfied with average returns (It has been researched many times that too many investors fail to get average returns). Morgan explains how to harness this massive industry and what strategy will get you the average return. The goal is to earn the average return over many years. Why? Two reasons:
1. 6.8% return over inflation is a great return!
2. Because our emotions will be spared the negative reactions from the massive swings (volatility) of the stock market which will set you up to panic and ‚Äúget out.‚Äù

This book will help you find that ""just right"" balance of your investments and your mind so you can sleep soundly with confidence and reach your financial goals over long periods of time. There is no get rich quick scheme. If a financial adviser or your best friend says that they can beat the averages, walk away, and never listen to that nonsense.

Housel encourages all investors by debunking one debilitating myth from the start. All you need to be a successful investor is patience, think long term, and one tiny piece of mathematics, the power of compound interest over decades. You do not need an MBA or a high IQ! In fact, for the newbie financial reader with no financial background or smarts, take heart, you have an advantage. He wrote: ""Ordinary folks with no formal financial education can be wealthy if they have a handful of behavioral skills that have nothing to do with formal measures of intelligence.""

That's me! I have never taken a financial course in my life. I flunked 2nd grade and I scored a lower than 100 IQ. But I had a huge advantage because I majored in psychology. Knowing how my mind functioned, I mitigated my return expectations of the market and drama during three of the biggest stock market crashes in history. My expectations for growth and losses are reasonable, balanced between stocks and fixed because I knew what the world-wide stock market returns since 1870. With my mind disciplined to stay the course forever and to do what I can do‚Äîcontrol the real deal by keeping expenses low and be extremely happy with reasonable returns. I have perfect control by paying myself instead of some Wall Street mucky muck's yacht.

For years, seasoned investors poo-poo psychology (read the one and two-star reviews of this book). There is at least one huge exception. One of the most significant financial thinkers of the 20th century and the mentor and professor of Warren Buffett. Ben Graham wrote said in the very first paragraph of his monumental 623 page The Intelligent Investor, ""‚Ä¶little will be said here about the technique of analyzing securities; attention will be paid chiefly to investment principles and investors' attitudes."" (1973 revised, page 1).

The author had the great wisdom to cite a book titled ‚ÄúEnough‚Äù by the legendary John Bogle. Morgan tells stories of people ""hit it big"" (IN THE BILLIONS!). It wasn‚Äôt ""enough."" They want more, and in the end, they lost it all. Bogle‚Äôs most famous quote to get the market averages mentioned previously is to invest in the ‚Äúentire haystack, do not look for the needle.‚Äù

The author makes an important statement that is long overdue and worth repeating‚Äîthe qualitative discussions of investing is more complicated than the quantitative discussions. It is humans that make the decisions and do all the trading on the stock exchanges throughout the world. Last I heard, humans have feelings. Housel says that science is exact and is governed by predictable physical laws. Molecules and atoms do not have feelings! But millions of investors do! Sir Isaac Newton would agree. He famously lamented after losing his investments to the South Sea Disaster in the 18th century, ""I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people."" Knowledge of psychology and behavior will help you understand and protect yourself from the ""madness of people.""

The author covers a lot of ground because there is a lot of human behavioral and psychological constructs to explain. Luck vs. skill, attitude vs. math, being average vs. being superior, uncertainty vs. certainty, and confidence born from wisdom vs. overconfidence born from recklessness are impossible to measure and explain. The author correctly labeled these constructs ‚Äúsoft skills‚Äù (Hard skills are the math, statistics, graphs, and tables). Luck, attitude, accepting average returns, uncertainty, long-term horizon, and overconfidence are difficult to explain without emotional pushback from some investors. Most seasoned investors want to be intelligent, act aggressive, appear confident, and look sophisticated and soft skills will not get them that image and beat the market.
We love to think successes originated on skills, knowledge, intelligence, spreadsheets, and math. The most vital reaction to many seasoned investors is downplaying luck to investment success. But Morgan won't have it. Making money from stock and bond investing is being smart with the complicated reality we face, and spreadsheet knowledge will not be enough. That being lucky is part of the equation. He admits that the luck factor is the question that might not be answered in our lifetimes.

In the meantime, there is nothing wrong with being lucky. The returns are green too. But most seasoned investors feel insulted. Warren Buffett always reports that he is an incredibly fortunate investor born in the United States. I am lucky that I am alive after contracting stage two colon cancer twenty years ago. Any one of us could have been born in a small village in India in abject poverty, a shantytown in Lima, Peru, or one of our country's public housing projects.

Unfortunately, I gave the book four stars. There was one paragraph that does not belong in the book. I was disappointed. I agree that I might be petty, but that paragraph doesn‚Äôt make any sense because it doesn‚Äôt follow the narrative throughout. On page 218, I rewrote here for those who use the indexing strategy, especially Bogleheads:

‚ÄúThat doesn‚Äôt mean index investing will always work. It doesn‚Äôt mean it is for everyone. And it doesn‚Äôt mean active stock picking is doomed to fail. In general, this industry has become too entrenched on one side or the other‚Äîparticularly those vehemently against active investing.‚Äù

Did the Author Lose His ‚ÄúPsychology‚Äù for a Moment?

I scratched my head and seriously wondered, has the author lost his mind? What in the world motivated the author had to write this when he shares how he invests, and it‚Äôs just like most Bogleheads and myself invest with low-cost index funds? I believe I can speak for most Bogleheads: of course, we are ‚Äúvehemently against active investing!‚Äù It‚Äôs expensive and flawed is thoroughly agreed upon by genuine fiduciary financial advisers. Furthermore, there are books, peer-reviewed academic articles, and the Bogleheads‚Äô forum experiences of how successful the indexing strategy has been overactive management. The author admits on the following page that 85% of active managers fail to beat the averages! The active management strategy has been proven dead for decades, and the author‚Äôs stories debunk active management. Over 35 million investors have their seven trillion dollars with Vanguard and TIAA. We know that active managers from Wall Street‚Äôs big banks and brokerage firms spend a lot of time sipping martinis on their yachts.

Other than that hideous paragraph, The Psychology of Money is a fine book because it makes a huge contribution to financial discussions and what it means to be financially literate. The qualitative argument of financial literacy is desperately needed in the financial world. The quantitative argument is appropriate for constructing your portfolio and understanding how markets only return 6.8% average for 150 years. I learned a ton by reading those books too. But after that, no amount of math, sophistication, financial engineering, or science will protect investors from a bear market. Only what is between our ears will. Investors must get our heads behind the idea that we are up against a massive industry that wants to use our money to make money for themselves.
The industry is playing a totally different game, different motivation, and most important different life values‚Äîthey spend 24/7 in front of their powerful computers trading for two goals only, bonuses and beating the averages. I have one more example of luck--We are lucky that Morgan Housel wrote this important work. It is not about looking at your finances 24/7, searching for that investment ‚Äúgem‚Äù that will make you rich quickly or to compete. At the end of the day, it is about doing our part in making the world a better place than it is now, being generous to those in need, be part of something bigger than yourself, and spending quality time with family and friends.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30TAIVAFIZBC8,Stephen S,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/8647b991-d4fe-4cf4-b355-5a4cb61b82a6._CR84,0,332,332_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on November 11, 2020",True,389 people found this helpful,B08D9WJ9G8,,,
340,R3IS1LVLJU9ZOK,"Save a little more, invest for the long term, and expect the unexpected.","Good investing is not about getting the highest returns. It‚Äôs about getting good returns that can be repeated for the longest period of time. ‚ÄúThe historical odds of making money in U.S. markets are 50/50 over one-day periods, 68% in one-year periods, 88% in 10-year periods, and (so far) 100% in 20-year periods.‚Äù The reality is that ‚Äúthere are few financial variables more correlated to performance than commitment to a strategy during its lean years‚Äîboth the amount of performance and the odds of capturing it over a given period of time.‚Äù With this in mind, the question remains: Why do so many of us buy and sell our stocks when it may in fact be best to do the opposite?

The answer is our emotions. Our emotions are what compel us to get married, to root for our favorite sports teams, and to buy our favorite foods. It would be difficult to choose a bag of chips at the supermarket without our emotions‚Äîwith so many options, all boasting different flavors and styles, pure rationality gets us stuck; we need our emotions to kick in and grab the bag that ‚Äòlooks‚Äô the best. In his book, our author has abundant examples of how we behave just the same when it comes to our money and investments, ultimately leading us to buy and sell when we shouldn‚Äôt.

One of Housel‚Äôs most important financial observations is recognizing what our time horizon is. Are we investing for a three-month period, a three-year period, or a thirty-year period? The answer to this question will determine what kinds of investments we should make. ‚ÄúYour personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of what‚Äôs happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works,‚Äù Housel writes, ‚Äúso equally smart people can disagree about how and why recessions happen, how you should invest your money, what you should prioritize, how much risk you should take, and so on.‚Äù There is rarely, if ever, a single answer to a financial question, and it is incumbent upon each of us to keep our time horizon in mind when making investment decisions.

We are only able to do this, however, if we have some money. Despite our desire to invest and grow our money, it is important to remember to keep some savings, or a ‚Äúmargin of safety,‚Äù in case of an emergency. Housel encourages his readers to save money for the unpredictable events that life will surely throw at us. A sudden medical illness or broken car part, for example. How many of us were financially prepared for Covid-19?

We invest to get wealthy, and while becoming wealthy may entail some risky bets on the stock market, the key to staying wealthy is not spending. ‚ÄúWealth is the nice cars not purchased. The diamonds not bought. The watches not worn, the clothes forgone and the first-class upgrade declined.‚Äù Real wealth is having control over our time, and getting to do what we want, when we want, with who we want, for as long as we want. The great philosopher Aristotle himself once wrote that ‚Äúwealth is evidently not the good we are seeking; for it is merely useful and for the sake of something else.‚Äù That something else is the freedom to do what we want with our time, and, by extension, our lives.

In sum, we should all save a little more than we think we should, invest our money for the long term, and expect the unexpected. Ups and downs in the market happen all the time for reasons we often cannot predict, and buying and selling in an effort to beat the market will rarely lead to large returns. The best investing is done over a long period of time when our money is able to compound and grow. This only works if we don‚Äôt let our emotions highjack our brains and we stick to our time horizon.

350,ROT23CNHIP8ZY,I am in love with this story.,"I'm convinced Penelope can do no wrong when she sits down to write a book. This book is at the top of my favorite Penelope list. I couldn't love this book more. I wanted to immediately read it again as soon as I finished it.

I loved how Emily didn't really know Tristan when she ran into him in the bathroom, which was definitely a change for Tristan. He was so used to women throwing themselves at him and just wanting him for his fame. Emily was the breath of fresh air that Tristan didn't know he needed in his life, so he knew he needed to have her accompany them on their US leg of the tour.

Emily wasn't prepared for a job interview when she arrived at the recording studio in the desert. She actually had another plan for the day. But when she is offered the position, she accepts it in the hopes that it will give her the clarity she needs. She wasn't expecting to see a different side of Tristan. She knows she shouldn't entertain the idea of being with him in any fashion considering their age difference and the fact that she is working for the band. But there is this pull they have towards each other that is undeniable.

I love the way Penelope writes the push and pull for these characters. They know they shouldn't even think about doing anything, but they truly just can't stay away from each other. Then Penelope threw in some twists that I was not expecting, and this story just went to a whole other level. There were so many circumstances keeping them apart. I loved seeing them navigate the life they thought they knew mixed with the life they would love to have.

352,R2LJVOIQY47GKS,Compelling Plot and Sui Generis Narrator Will Entertain and Delight!,"I immediately became enthralled by the first-person protagonist in ‚ÄúCreation Lake‚Äù, by Rachel Kushner. Her alias is ‚ÄúSadie Smith‚Äù; she‚Äôs ruthless, wry, sardonic, full of hubris, and she‚Äôs a deliciously unreliable narrator: my favorite kind!

She is an American, a former spy for a federal agency now working in the UK for ‚Äúprivate interests‚Äù (read: a mercenary). She has no qualms about her assignment to infiltrate and manipulate an anarchist commune in rural France devoted to the collapse of Capitalism, called Le Moulin.

As she plots and plans to trap Le Moulin into a violent protest over rural/farmer‚Äôs water rights, she surreptitiously reads emails sent to the collective by a mysterious former radical named Bruno, who has abandoned his anarchist stance and is now preaching non-violence. Bruno is living outside of civilization (in caves) and is advising Le Moulin, by way of teaching them about anthropology and astrology: emphasis on the Neanderthals and Polaris. What does it mean to detach from the future and live in the now? Eventually, Sadie must confront the big existential questions Bruno evinces.

Are Bruno‚Äôs missives an indication of madness or genius? How will Sadie‚Äôs machinations play out? Will it turn out to be a trap for Le Moulin or for Sadie? I couldn‚Äôt wait to find out!

This was an interesting concept - I enjoyed the parts of the story which existed. The first 20% of the book read like the author's research notes. So boring. Then as we went along it was a tiny bit of story with a lot of tedious philosophical musings. There wasn't a likeable character in the bunch - so when somebody you hate starts meandering, it grinds. This book took way longer to read than necessary. We don't (and shouldn't) talk about Bruno. Ugh. The worst of the lot.

The story is intriguing and the setting is so evocative of its time and place - it really draws you into its world. And it's just a compelling mystery, suspensefully plotted and paced to keep you coming back for more.

But actually it's a lot more than a good mystery. It's a portrayal of the social, class, and gender dynamics of the 1950s to 1970s, and a particularly pointed depiction of how those dynamics impacted women, often to tragic effect. And about how women struggled to make the best of their circumstances, with varying success.

361,R7N1OWXNLAVTU,"The third rule of Camp Emerson is the most important, ‚ÄòWhen lost sit down and yell.‚Äô","Just like the battle cry of Pan: The Greek God of the Woods.

Situated in the Adirondack Mountains is the Van Laar Preserve. Atop its ridge is the Van Laar‚Äôs colossal summer home, named Self-Reliance. Far below, is the camp they own, Camp Emerson, which is open to campers eight weeks of the year (June to August).

July 1961: 8-year-old, Peter ‚ÄúBear‚Äù Van Laar the fourth (the only child of Peter the third and his wife Alice) vanishes without a trace while hiking with his grandfather (Peter II) in the Adirondacks near the family home Self-Reliance. Following an extensive search no trace of him is ever found.

August 1975: The girls in Balsam cabin, Camp Emerson, awaken to find 13-year-old Barbara‚Äôs bunk bed empty. Barbara‚Äôs surname is also Van Laar ‚Äì she‚Äôs Bear‚Äôs younger sister, born after his disappearance, to replace the void he left.

Is the Van Laar line cursed? Surely it can‚Äôt be a coincidence that they‚Äôre two children from the same privileged family! Or are they simply two separate unrelated tragedies? What happened to Bear, and then Barbara?

If I could rate The God of the Woods 14 stars (for the 14 cabins of Camp Emerson) then I absolutely positivity would, but I guess 5 stars is enough to convey just how immersive, momentous, and affecting it was. A flawlessly written epic masterpiece of literary suspense fiction, and deep dive character study. There were twists that left me reeling over how shockingly clever they were, and Liz Moore‚Äôs use of misdirection and carefully concealed clues were meticulously placed. Every once and a while there is a book that comes along that is so special that I find myself taking much longer than normal to read it, inhaling every word, and taking frequent breaks to reflect on the plot, and characters, to prolong the experience, and The God of the Woods was one such example.

The story contained many gothic elements which increased my sense of unease and claustrophobia tenfold. A prickling sensation at the back of my neck permeated the novel from the very first page. First up, was the secluded setting, far enough away from the nearest town of Shattuck to be isolating, surrounded by endless wilderness and the looming Hunt Mountain, with Lake Joan cutting them off even further. Then there were the dilapidated log cabins, once used for hunting parties, complete with unused fireplaces, whose chimneys were occasionally inhabited by bats. Not to mention the origins of Self-Reliance ‚Äì there was something off-putting and out-of-place about it previously being a Chalet in Switzerland, transported by ship to New York piece-by-piece and then reassembled on the Van Laar Preserve. As expected, there were numerous campfire style legends circulating ‚Äì whispered stories warning of Slitter, of Scary Mary, and Old John.  And last but not least, the plot was built around not one, but two disturbing enthralling mysteries.

Those who know me are aware that I love a summer camp setting and this novel contained everything I wanted in one ‚Äì new friendships, secretive and untrustworthy behaviour, counsellors and campers sneaking around after dark, campfires, sing-a-longs, swimming, hiking, a camper survival trip in the woods, and an end of summer dance. The vivid and intricate descriptions of the campgrounds really brought Camp Emerson to life. There was also a handy map included at the front of the book, showing the layout of the grounds and buildings.

And I was thrilled that the author chose to set the camp story arc in the 70's ‚Äì I adored the nostalgic trip, the slang, and pop culture references. The 1950‚Äôs/1960‚Äôs timelines were equally compelling. Instead of Camp Emerson, that plot focused on Self-Reliance and Peter and Alice's marriage within its walls, and of course, Bear's disappearance, and what lead up to it, and the fallout resulting from it.

The majority of the POV‚Äôs were pre-teen/teenage girls and twenty-something women (with the exception of Alice in 1975. She was 41 by this stage), and most of them were damaged or broken (and given what they'd been dealt in life I'm not surprised), beaten down and trapped by their circumstances. Back then women were considered inferior ‚Äì utterly dependent on the men in their lives to make decisions for them regarding how to look, act, and behave. And a lot of the male characters in this book took advantage of this ‚Äì were dismissive, controlling and abusive. Not only that when female characters were abused by men, they saw it as their failure, and thought it was them who needed to change, who needed to be more compliant. And those who did take a stand were belittled, mocked, and shunned, by both men and women, for not conforming to the norm.

Class, prejudice, injustice, and resentment was another prominent theme. With the Van Laar family and their rich, entitled friends on one side, and the locals from Shattuck (including camp staff, counsellors, household staff, and caretakers) on the other. Self-Reliance, sat high on the hill, on prominent display, lording it over everyone, literally and figuratively, looking down on people. Even its name, Self-Reliance, was an exclusion, a slap in the face for the townspeople, implying that the Van Laar‚Äôs had build it themselves with no assistance, when it had been the entire eligible male population of Shattuck who had done so, with no help from the Van Laar‚Äôs. And even the fact that the camp staff quarters were situated way down lake from Self-Reliance in the farthest south corner possible, placed in the half of the camp separated by a creek, spoke volumes.

The God of the Woods was in my opinion a smash-hit and I strongly urge everyone to read it and experience the magic for themselves. My top read for 2024 so far. Actually, top read full stop.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R7N1OWXNLAVTU,NZLisaM,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/e223ec09-e3b1-418c-9cec-a1ee190dd2dd._CR0,0,447,447_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2024",True,87 people found this helpful,B0CLH8D891,,,
362,RX82PD6VGSPTT,I Really Wanted to Love This Book,"This book is definitely one where a chance to rate it separately on several different aspects would be helpful.  It‚Äôs well written in comparison with a lot of other current novels.  The plot is engaging and rocks along at a decent pace, for the most part the characters are well flushed out, and the setting is described in sufficient detail to draw the reader into the story.  Five stars for basic craftsmanship.  However, there are several shortcomings.  The story is littered with way too many characters and subplots that serve as fillers and distractions.  For example, there are a great number of pages devoted to Tracy, a likable character who ultimately adds nothing to the overall story.  Likewise for the character of Louise (who‚Äôs initially targeted as a suspect), we are provided with extensive details of her background (alcoholic mother, struggling younger brother), but this subplot only meanders eventually to a wan conclusion.  Two stars for unnecessary subplots and background clutter.  The main thrust of the novel is the story of a brother and sister born of wealthy parents, who both go missing in upstate New York some 14 years apart.  Older brother ‚ÄúBear‚Äù vanished first, casting a shadow over the entire family.  Younger sister Barbara, lonely and neglected, disappears in the same area years later.  The young inspector working on Barbara‚Äôs disappearance is the most interesting character in the book and I‚Äôd like to see more of her:  Judyta.  She deserves a story where she‚Äôs front and center.  Judyta, inexperienced and facing a variety of skeptical witnesses needing to be interviewed, as well as the not so subtle disdain and chauvinism of her male  colleagues, manages to solve both disappearances.  Unfortunately, the climax of this novel is where it really goes off track and into the ditch.  Have you ever read a novel where you reached the last page, closed the book, and wanted to throw it through the nearest window?  Yeah, that kind of going off track.  The solutions to both mysteries are preposterous, far fetched, ridiculous, unsatisfactory. . .  I‚Äôm running out of adjectives here.

This story is about two missing kids, first is Bear Van Laar son of the wealthy family who own the land the summer camp is on. He goes missing in 1961 and then his sister Barbara Van Laar goes missing while attending the summer camp in August 1975. His disappearance and the impact it had on all the characters was much more interesting than Barbara's disappearance. I found the Van Laar's to be the typical old money Dutch families that used to hold sway over the NY area. They are truly loathsome. It's hard to not hate any one of them. I did like how the story tied up loose ends but didn't really explain what happened to Alice Van Laar. It kind of just brushed her off.

Mothers often controlled their daughters too much, as it was their only power.  This reality is the drive of the plot in the story.

Sanchez is a federal Homeland Security agent who investigates the attempted murder of her sister even though the event does not fall under federal jurisdiction. She solicits the help of a guy who she had previously arrested who is a computer systems ‚Äúgenius‚Äù and hacker. Together they catch a serial killer and a gang of murder mercenaries who are using the dark web in a plot to commit a contract kill.

The subject is a bit uncomfortable because it lays out a organized system that killers and murders use to commit their crimes. I was totally unaware that this kind of thing exists and while this is a book of fiction I have to believe that this type of website probably exists on the Dark Web. It is the whole concept that this kind of thing actually occurs made this an uncomfortable read.

It opens Deaver style, playing with your expectations, but soon Maldanado‚Äôs smoother style seems to come to the fore. Sure, there are surprises within surprises, as is true of of the Deaververse, but here they seem to appear organcally instead of being inserted merely to shock. And it's a nice change: Deaver was beginning to parody himself in the Lincoln Rhyme series.

It‚Äôs a great partnership, as great as the partnership that develops between Carmen Sanchez, the Homeland Security investigator, and her  sometime ‚Äúpartner‚Äù computer consultant Jake Heron.
They do not meet cute. It's a like-hate hate relationship in this case, but reluctantly Sanchez realizes she needs Heron if she's going to solve the case.

The authors, however, have made one mistake (at least I think it is). They compress the action into four days, and there's simply too much going on for it to have happened realistically in 96 hours. But perhaps I'm over-bothered by this.

388,R14Y7VUD3ZTGI0,A timeless classic of self-discovery!,"A Fable About Following Your Dream

Twenty-five years ago, Paulo Coelho's 'The Alchemist' first enchanted readers around the world. Since then, this timeless fable has sold over 150 million copies, inspiring countless individuals to embrace their dreams and follow their hearts.

A Journey of Self-Discovery

'The Alchemist' follows the story of Santiago, a young shepherd from Andalusia, who embarks on an extraordinary journey to the distant pyramids of Egypt. Guided by a wise old king, Santiago learns that his destiny lies not in the familiar paths of his past but in the unknown realms of his dreams.

Along the way, Santiago encounters an alchemist, who teaches him the secrets of turning the base metal of his life into the gold of his potential. He learns the importance of listening to his heart, embracing change, and never giving up on his aspirations.

The Power of Personal Legend

The central theme of 'The Alchemist' is the pursuit of one's 'Personal Legend.' This is the unique purpose for which each individual is born, the reason they exist. Santiago's Personal Legend is to reach the pyramids, but along his journey, he discovers that the path itself is as important as the destination.

The pursuit of our Personal Legends often requires us to overcome obstacles, face setbacks, and leave behind the familiar. 'The Alchemist' reminds us that these challenges are essential for our growth and that the rewards we gain from following our dreams far outweigh the risks involved.

The Importance of Following Your Heart

One of the most profound lessons Santiago learns is the importance of following his heart. Despite the fears and doubts that may arise, he trusts his intuition and takes the path that feels right to him.

'The Alchemist' teaches us that our hearts hold the key to our true nature and our purpose in life. When we listen to our hearts, we are guided to the people, places, and experiences that align with our destiny.

A Timeless Classic

'The Alchemist' has become a beloved classic for a reason. Its timeless message of self-discovery, the pursuit of dreams, and the power of following your heart resonates with readers of all ages and backgrounds.

As we celebrate the 25th anniversary of this literary masterpiece, let us remember the lessons it teaches. May we all embrace our Personal Legends, trust our hearts, and embark on extraordinary journeys of our own.

The ultimate reward is not a classic ‚Äútreasure‚Äù but the opening of his ‚Äúsoul‚Äù and this process is aided and abetted by none other than God, disguised appropriately as an alchemist.

This story is in many ways the typical passage of adolescence into adulthood . If life is a dream, as I believe, this is a well told story, regarding plot and both inner and outer landscape descriptions.

I plowed through this faster then I wanted to, I wanted to savor it more, go slowly, if I could, since I waited sooo long for this to finally come out.

To her great relief there was a beautiful mountain resort that was the epitome of a fairy tale cottage in the woods, only with a five star chef making dinner in the main dining hall. Will is so romantic, is all that Sarah could think, except for the strange family that ran the lodge. There was definitely a weird undercurrent of something ugly there, but that wasn‚Äôt Sarah and Will‚Äôs business.

That was until their romantic midnight interlude was interrupted by a scream, and Will found Mercy, the daughter and manager barely alive in lake. The woman died in Will‚Äôs arms and they had to out themselves as GBI to both guests and owners to establish where everyone was at the time of the murder.

When Faith finally arrives she says she always wanted to solve a locked room murder and this one is a doozy. Everyone at the lodge had a motive to kill Mercy, and there is dark and ugly talk everywhere and Will and Sarah don‚Äôt know who to trust.

406,R1RN0ROS9B9R8R,A Captivating Fantasy Romance That Hooks You from the Start,"I was completely swept away by Sarah J. Maas's ""A Court of Thorns and Roses."" From the opening pages, I was immersed in the richly imagined world of the fae and the gripping story of Feyre, a brave and resourceful heroine.

Feyre's journey from a tough huntress in the human realm to her unwilling entry into the dangerous faerie lands is thrilling and suspenseful. The author does an excellent job of slowly revealing the complex and layered world of the faeries, with its ancient feuds, shifting alliances, and hidden powers.

What really makes this book shine is the character development. Feyre is a complex and relatable protagonist - tough and pragmatic on the outside, but with a well of emotion and vulnerability underneath. Her growing relationship with the enigmatic faerie lord Tamlin is by turns hostile, wary, and ultimately sizzling with chemistry.

The world-building is simply stunning, with vivid descriptions that bring the faerie realm and its inhabitants to life. From the lush Spring Court to the sinister Weaver's lair, every setting is richly imagined and integral to the story.

While the book starts a bit slow, it builds to an action-packed and emotionally charged climax that left me eager for the next installment.

407,R1I0025O311D89,Doesn‚Äôt deserve the hate,"Okay so... I might lost some of my favorite critics over this because I know a lot of you weren‚Äôt a fan of this book. And I have some pretty intense feelings about some of the biggest criticisms lmao. I will talk about some flaws with the book still, as no book is perfect. But for the most part I really loved it. There will be rants. I have ALOT to say. Sooo here we go before I lose my nerve lmao.

My main petty annoyance: the fact that tamlin uses his paws the same way a human uses hands even when he‚Äôs in beast form lol. There I said it. Now let‚Äôs move on to hopefully not my most controversial review ever. I feel like I‚Äôm supposed to hate MAAS and her writing. But I don‚Äôt. I really love what she did here.

Characters:
Feyre:
I really don‚Äôt get the hate. Maybe she gets worse later. Maybe. But people hate her in this book too and I don‚Äôt get why. She was meh to me. I admired her in some ways and hated her in others. I loved her heart, and how often she let it guide her even if it resulted in her ignoring everything anyone told her. Which yes- did annoy me sometimes. But it wasn‚Äôt that bad.

now we get to the fun part.

Tamlin and rhyes (similar thoughts on both)-
Oh my god. The reasons you guys hate this dude are absurd in this book. Every single thing I was told to look out for and that would start me into hating him was ridiculous. I genuinely believe you guys just don‚Äôt ship him and feyre so that makes him immediately sooo horrible. Same for the rhyes haters.

You guys have to stop inserting in a fantasy setting and acting like any of the decisions made are simple. Both of them are great in their own way- and both had feyres interest in mind in my opinion. The questionable things they do, because yes there are some...Are either for show to SAVE feyre and everyone else. It‚Äôs all so obviously calculated and here you guys are trying to critique it like they‚Äôre events that happened over tea in a totally normal world with nothing intense or life threatening going on around them. Just why.

I‚Äôm team Rhys just because I like him a little more- and I love the way he thinks and speaks. But I also love tamlin and am still rooting for him to be happy.

I think they‚Äôre both fleshed out brilliantly and have many layers that I can‚Äôt wait to uncover. They both have scars and they BOTH have really unfortunate situations that are eating away at them that make them who they are. I‚Äôm just saying... think about the alternative that could happen  if they didn‚Äôt make some of their questionable choices.

They wouldn‚Äôt have done half the stuff they did for this one human... if they didn‚Äôt truly care.

Villain-

Well she‚Äôs like not very nice lol so of course I don‚Äôt like her and I‚Äôm not rooting for her but...idk I put her here because I did kind of have a problem with how stupid she seemed to be for someone who was supposed to be cunning. She let certain people get away with way too much, and didn‚Äôt seem to notice or care. It was strange because then she would just randomly turn into a brutal witch out of nowhere but then let certain things happen other times. I‚Äôm sure some of it was her calculating but... still. It seemed a little weak.

She‚Äôs bitter, brutal and interesting. The ring, will probably haunt my nightmares. She just wasn‚Äôt as developed.

Lucien-

I don‚Äôt want him with feyre but I just wanted to say... despite me liking tam and rhyes... Lucien will forever be my babe. I love him the most. He‚Äôs so complex and he‚Äôs been through so much.

He‚Äôs witty, intelligent, and overall just cares about people even when he pretends he doesn‚Äôt. I want nothing but greatness for him lol. His story is heart breaking as well.

The rest- this story is filled with intriguing, misunderstood, and terrifying creatures. No complaints there.

Her family- feyres family is on my poop list. But  I don‚Äôt hate nesta even now as some of you seem to. Maybe I‚Äôm a mean bitter person... Idk.

The plot-

Like every plot it has both weak and strong points. I loved seeing the world unfold, and getting to see a good chunk of it before the action started.

I did think the twist with the masks and how convenient all of the events were was well... convenient....while it did lead to the most exciting parts, I felt like the point of it was kinda glossed over and the explanation for why things were how they are wasn‚Äôt too important to the story.

But it came over decently- and the ending wasn‚Äôt terrible. So I‚Äôm happy.

I still got the magical yet unsettling experience I wanted. And I can‚Äôt wait to see more of this world.

I really feel like it‚Äôs just the cool thing to hate maas and these books now. But I don‚Äôt see them as problematic as a lot of people seem to. I had an incredibly enjoyable time reading them, and I saw the reasons behind the words .

Think what you want about me because of that lol. I will not defend myself for not seeing the issues other people see.

in short

It seemed fitting to post my review of ACOTAR during Something Strange and Deadly week, given that Sarah and Sue are uber-besties.  I will preface by saying: I have a huge blind spot when it comes to Sarah Maas.  There were bits of this book that might have bugged me more if it had been another author.  That said, ACOTAR stands solidly on its own.  It's older than Throne of Glass, more mature, but without traipsing into drug store romance territory.  The whole atmosphere is ridiculous with magic and fairy gorgeousness.  You enter the world and immediately are steeped in its legends.  You meet Feyre, a sharp-tongued badass who taught herself archery to feed her family.  She's a firebrand and I love her.  One wrong move has her whisked away to faerie-land to live with Tamlin, sizzlingly handsome faerie Lord and certified mental eye-candy.  The relationship between them heats up slowly and burns bright.  But there's a darkness as well, a plot that threatens both of their worlds.  I wish that the evil part of the plot had been more prominent and taken up more space; I also found the ending turn a little eye-rolly.  However, I still gobbled it up.  ACOTAR transported me as a good fantasy should, and left me impatient for more.

in depth

in this loose beauty and the beast retelling,
Meet Feyre.  Once a gentlewoman until her family's fortune was lost, she now lives with her father and two sisters in a quaint cottage.  She's the definition of fierce.  With her father a self-made invalid, her proud and idle sister Nesta, and her naive and lazy sister Elain, she's the family's sole hope.  She's scrabbled her way from starvation to survival, teaching herself to use a bow, to trade, to adapt.  So she's smart enough to recognize a fae when she sees one, and to kill it.  In a twist on the original tale, it's Feyre whose crime has brought doom, and she is given a choice: death, or life in the faerie realm, away from all she's ever known.  Obviously, she chooses the non-dead version.  She's brought to a magical castle where the Beast's curse is reimagined: masks that can never be removed, and a sickness in his magic.

there are hearts at stake,
It's a little less obvious why Tamlin might need a girl than the Beast, but stick with it.  You'll be rewarded with a sweet, slow-moving romance.  I'll admit: I found Tamlin a little boring.  He's broody, tortured, and has some magical rage issues that beg a nuanced dialogue around healthy relationships.  I preferred Lucien, who's witty and petulant.  But in the end, I came to appreciate Tamlin's kind and gentle nature.  His romance with Feyre is built on a rocky beginning; she hates and fears him, and longs for escape.  But of course, they come to know each other more deeply, to appreciate each other's quirks and passions.  I'd have liked more conversations between them, but we do get plenty of steaminess.  And I'll say it: I usually find sex scenes laughable, but Maas avoids ridiculous euphemisms and actually gives her steamy scenes some emotional power.  In other news, I'm hoping that the Rhys thing doesn't become a triangle thing, because unbalanced power dynamics aren't sexy.

but also the fate of a magical world.
Alas, the lovers cannot be in peace, for there is a curse upon the Courts of the faerie land.  Magic is becoming weaker and more unpredictable.  Dangerous creatures lurk beyond their borders, creatures that feed on fear and soul.  It soon becomes clear that the land is being corrupted from within--and its collapse could mean devastation for mankind.  Feyre isn't complacent.  She's reckless, for sure, but she's determined to find out what Tamlin can't tell her.  Along the way she meets Rhys, a seductively wicked fae lord who may be her aid--for a price.  Her curiosity leads her into a twisted game of intrigue, revenge, and evil.  It's a thrilling mystery that kept me on my toes.  It all leads up to a do-or-die moment, when Feyre must show her own power and become a savior.

there are a few instances of flimsiness.
I did have my issues.  ACOTAR didn't feel as tightly plotted as Throne of Glass.  Some of the character motivations seemed flimsy.  There were also few positive female characters--at least not any who stuck around for more than a few pages.  I really wanted more of Nesta and Elain, particularly as Nesta was so dynamic across the plot.  The villain, in particular, came off flat.  Not to mention a couple moments of victim blaming that made me squirmy.  But my main disappointment was with the trials Fayre faces to save Tamlin.  They were so freaking cool, but they came towards the end of the book.  As a result, they felt rushed and I felt skeptical that so much had been accomplished so soon.  Fayre does have a habit of doing crazy things that should probably kill her.  But maybe the most frown-worthy part involved a riddle.  I guessed the answer within the first two lines, so the final reveal was more meh than gasp-worthy.

even so, sharp and atmospherically written,
Despite these missteps, ACOTAR is a fabulous example of craft.  Maas' writing has always had a fairy tale quality to it; that's used to advantage here, where everything she describes seems extra mystical and chilling.  She's concocted a fabulous fantasy world.  Her fae are old gods, held back from ruling humanity only by an ancient treaty.  They live within seven courts--such as Dawn, Summer, and Night--that tensely coexist.  For some reason, I really geeked out about the courts.  It felt like a detail ripped from Grimm, but all Maas.  This is also a dangerous world, and I would have liked to see more of it.  There are nightmare creatures who lure you in with their seductive telepathy, goblins and ghouls, man-eating monsters who foretell the future.  It's a fairy land with a deliciously dark edge.

it's the new adult we've all craved and deserved.
I usually avoid new adult.  I have it on good faith that they're all much the same.  College girl meets boy.  Hatred.  Brooding.  Sexy times.  OMGLOVERAINBOWS.  It's just stupid.  But many adult books deal with marriage and kids, things I can't yet relate to.  So it's about freaking time that new adult diversified, just as young adult has done.  With ACOTAR, you get all the steam and romance, but you also get an exciting adventure story.  I can only hope that Maas' success will pave the way for other NA with actual plots.

410,R3VK9QJS2SGVVB,Great retelling of Beauty and the beast,"Rating: üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü/5

Overall Feelings: I ordered this book without the second book‚Ä¶.or the third‚Ä¶.or fourth‚Ä¶you get the picture. By the time I was a few chapters in, I ordered the entirety of the series. At first, I was a thrown a little off kilter, as you usually are when diving into a completely new book world where the first 100 pages are world building.

The beginning also gave me serious Beauty and the Beast vibes with Tamlin being so mysterious and broody, but slowly warming to Feyre. Lucien was a favorite of mine, with his snarky quips and fox-like behavior. The build to the climax that I thought was going to happen changed wildly. I love and hate that Tamlin sent Feyre home after their relationship built so much, and I pulled my hair our when she refused to say she loved him. Killed me a little inside to read that.

Then, her struggles to free Tamlin from the Queen only showed her growth more and made me love Lucien so much more also. Also‚Ä¶.also. The twist at the end!

Overall, I cannot wait for the next book to arrive.

Characters: Feyre: She was easy for me to enjoy early on. I felt like Maas easily conveyed Feyre‚Äôs emotions, and I felt that when we meet Feyre, you can tell that she has been hardened by a rough few years. Her family has shown her little kindness despite the fact that she puts the food on the table and goes without so her sisters can enjoy the money she brings in.

Sometimes she drove me up a wall, like disobeying Tamlin and going to the Fire Night ritual‚Ä¶..but she met Rhysand that night, and isn‚Äôt he just delicious? However, we‚Äôll come back to that. Feyre showed great strength and loyalty after Tamlin sent her away and she returned. I almost think that the last bit of the book where she is locked away awaiting her trials is my favorite part of the book.

Tamlin: He is a character I‚Äôm sure that the next book will show me that I was a fool to love. I was totally sucked in by his ‚Äúmercy‚Äù that he showed to Feyre. I thought, ‚Äúoh, how kind he is to offer her a place in his palace in exchange for Andras‚Äô life.‚Äù Ha! What a fool! I appreciated his similarities to the Beast from Beauty and the Beast, his uncontrolled rage, his tentative romance with Feyre, and his friendship with those that are stuck in his palace.

I got more and more frustrated with him as time went on and he sat quietly by, and it seemed that Lucien was more interested in helping Feyre than Tamlin. I think Tamlin could have done a great deal more to woo Feyre and break his curse. It was also kind of meh thinking about his Fire Night ritual and how he sleeps with one Fae then turns around and expects Feyre to open up and be willing? Negative.

Lucien: I loved him. I can‚Äôt wait for his book. He was mischievous and playful. He was snide and sarcastic and just a great character. Lucien time and time again risked so much for Feyre that I almost wanted her to fall for him because he seemed like a much better character than Tamlin. Lucien ‚Äúprotected‚Äù Feyre from Rhysand when he burst in while they were sharing a meal.

He basically offered himself up on a platter while Feyre was facing the trials. He risked himself time and time again, saying it was on behalf of Tamlin. I don‚Äôt buy it though. Maybe a bit was on behalf of Tamlin, but I think Lucien is a better person than Tamlin.

Rysand: I mean duh. He had to be in here. I hated him at first, but I grew to love him. He‚Äôs interesting and complex. I wasn‚Äôt sure about him, but he‚Äôs obviously drawn to Feyre and did some level of protecting her during her time Under the Mountain. Was it a little self serving? Yes. However, he‚Äôs meant to be a villain‚Ä¶.ish?

Moving on. The whole sex thing. I saw a review on amazon call this erotica‚Ä¶‚Ä¶uh. Ma‚Äôam you would be horrified by actual erotica if that were the case. In any case, I don‚Äôt think they even have sex more than two or three times and it is not as exciting as some reviewers make it out to be.

412,R2YFUHYOQ4IN7B,An imperfect love - but I still read in twice in 48 hours!,"Read more of my thoughts about this book and others here: http://bluedollarbill.blogspot.com/2015/05/time-for-another-book-review.html

This is what I get for reading so much YA fantasy, I suppose, instead of legit grown-up literary stuff. Most of the time, it doesn't quite live up to my expectations, but then when it exceeds them, it's just extraordinary. It's always a pleasure to lose yourself in another world, and it's a kind of exquisite joy to marvel at the flexibility and grace of someone else's imagination. Like watching a rhythmic gymnast.

For a change of pace, I read Sarah J. Maas' A Court of Thorn and Roses, which I had preordered, based on my love for her Throne of Glass series and my fondness for the story of Tam Lin. Let's talk about Throne of Glass for a minute: Maas has a fairly cool story. She started writing this series as Queen of Glass on FictionPress when she was a teenager and finally got it published many years (and many revisions) later. It's supposed to be a riff on Cinderella, but only in the sense that Cinderella is the fairy tale that set the author's imagination wandering. The first book, Throne of Glass, grew on me. As a YA fantasy writer, Maas is not Laini Taylor or Maggie Stiefvater. Her sentences don't echo in my head, over and over, like a favorite song. But there is a delight to her characters and their relationships to each other, a sense of humor, sarcasm, witty, good-natured ribbing that washes over the reader like a cup of hot chocolate. Her characters (like Stiefvater's) feel like old friends. Her main character is a girl, an assassin, a voracious reader, who loves music, candy, and beautiful gowns, and manages to be both selfless and self-centered, able to revel to luxury and capable of surviving anything. It doesn't always quite add up - if you pause for too long - but stay immersed in Maas' world and it works.

Also, they wear really awesome clothes. Maas uses Pinterest to good effect - the women, especially, are breathtakingly dressed and she does a fabulous job describing the fashion. On the downside, she does clearly have particular turns of phrase and descriptors she loves to use, and a LOT of people wear clothes that are &#34;simple but obviously of very fine make.&#34; It's repetitious, yes, but mostly it just makes me jealous - why can't I find basic, high-quality clothes like white linen shirts that fit me flawlessly and &#34;supple leather&#34; boots than mold to my feet? (Cuyana, please make a few more things. And make the fit a little less unisex. Please.)

For the most part, the plot of Throne of Glass (so far - there are three books out in a six- or seven-book series) works and the twists and turns are intriguing and satisfying. The back story is impressively well-developed. (It's so well-developed, in fact, that I hesitate to return to writing my own novel out of fear that I don't have the imagination to pull it off. Like J.K. Rowling, even the smallest details and introduction of apparently minor characters has major relevance for the plot.) There is a major plot hole in the second book - something that really never makes sense - but it's possible to overlook it and jump back into the flow of the story. Do you ever do that? Simply choose to pretend that your favorite author didn't actually mean what they wrote? As long the rest of the story makes sense without the problematic element, I do - all the time. Often, the problematic element is an illogical explanation for a supporting character's actions and I can imagine into place a more logical one. I reserve my greatest agonizing for books that are beautifully set up, with elegant words and fascinating characters, but where the illogical element ruins all the downstream events and the book collapses like a house of cards.

Where are the editors, I wonder? I should be editing these books.

A Court of Thorns and Roses doesn't quite collapse but it's on shaky ground. The main character never has the depth of the protagonist from Throne of Glass. She's less outlandish and yet less fully realized too - she seems like a mashup of Cinderella and Katniss from The Hunger Games. Both she and the male protagonist are so reserved and laconic that it's rather hard to get to know them, as the reader. That's okay - she still does a better job than most. I think magic is hard to work with, in a story - authors really have to know what the rules are, or readers will question why anything happens the way it does. The rules are perhaps not quite as well-defined in Court of Thorns and Roses as I'd like, but the real problem in the logic comes only in the last quarter of the book. (That's probably why I enjoyed it as much as I did.) Essentially, the last quarter introduces an intriguing antagonist of questionable loyalties but his loyalties aren't quite questionable enough - it's a mystery why the main antagonist lets him get away with playing for both sides as much as he does. Alas, when I'm faced with that kind of mystery, I usually conclude that the author knew where she wanted her story to go and didn't spend enough time thinking through how to get from point A to point B. And then I blame the editor for not being objective enough to see the problem. Because, at least in this case, it could have been written in a way that was more believable, less dependent on luck. And I would have liked it a lot more.

The second problem is harder to describe without spoilers and, indeed, a long explanation of the plot. Essentially, it has to do with why one of the main characters is himself an obstacle to his own romance (which drives much of the plot). The reason makes sense, after the reader has spent some time thinking about it and turning it over and over in her mind. The problem is that the bits and pieces provided by the first-person limited narrator are barely sufficient to realize why he acts as does - and not sufficient to make it wholly believable. Does that make sense? Without nuance, if I were to summarize the plot for someone, this aspect of the plot, of character development and motivation, would make sense and seem quite powerful; but the book needed more richness and detail in this regard to make it &#34;real on paper.&#34;

Of course, NONE of this means that I'm not going to pre-order the next book in the trilogy (and mark the date on my calendar) as soon as it's available.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2YFUHYOQ4IN7B,amaltheaB,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/518MBkAXWJL._CR0,10.0,313,313_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on May 25, 2015",True,One person found this helpful,B00OZP5VRS,,,

414,RMKJG4KVVSZZG,"Not a perfect book, but a good book 1.","I bought the trilogy. All together they were the best books I've read in a while. Separately, they were not perfect but I'm okay with that. I read a lot and tend to dislike books that show no character growth, or have wishy-washy villains, or have insta-love, or have love result from H saving h from sexual violation, or suffer from deus ex machina. I don't particularly care if something is obvious because sometimes I want to read something that is easy and obvious. My brain doesn't want to be challenged 24/7. Also, I love good dialogue- dialogue makes a romantic connection feel real rather than insta-lovey. Is dialogue action-packed? No. Does it slow down pacing? You bet. At this point, you're probably wondering where this review is going? Well, I think that knowing more about me as a reader might make it easier to see/ relate to my views for this book.

Now the fun stuff! ***SPOILERS***

Feyre (the h):
This character is complex and goes through several changes throughout the series. In this book, she has her ups and downs. Initially, she is hardened, street-smart and capable with a cynical eye toward romance and happiness and outright hatred and prejudice towards the fae. She also has love for a family who seems to dislike and neglect her. She is not very likeable. But does that make a book bad? No. (Hello, Wuthering Heights.) It is, however, more rare to write an h this way because readers in general tend to want to relate to an h, particularly when it's written in 1st person perspective. So many readers might not be able to get into the story because of their dislike for Feyre. When the far remove her burdens that largely drove who she was, Feyre changes. She doesn't have a purpose to keep her going, to shape her. The pacing of the book suffers a bit here while she tries to sort herself out. She tries to make love and painting her new purposes, and while she has the determination to do so, the fit just isn't right. Does this make the book bad? No. While many people won't like to read about an h that seems somehow &#34;less&#34; this downward arc was necessary to fuel the inevitable reversal toward a more fitting purpose. It drags a bit for sure, but makes the reversal feel more right, more true later on. Did she rush into something with Tamlin. Her feelings do feel a bit rushed but ultimately fit her as a character- going all-in has always been her style from the start. In that sense, the character is consistent. Also, her reluctance to voice her love made me think that deep-down she might have confused love with gratitude. Tamlin was her savior in many ways. For all of these reasons I liked Feyre.

Tamlin (the H):
Tamlin was the 1st high fae Feyre had any meaningful interactions with in the 1st book.  I never really liked him as an H. He was pretty but basically hollow. He struggles with uncontrolled rage. He had just as much hatred for humans as Feyre did for fae, and his elitist attitude was hinted at throughout this book (though not substantiated until book 2). He also adheres to fae tradition in weird ways- his willing participation in the Fire Night ritual is distasteful because it borders on infidelity (especially since we later learn in book 2 that he can designate a replacement). Tamlin has from the beginning been primarily focused on Tamlin. When things get tough, he sends Feyre away; he doesn't consult or listen to her, but just decides, hinting at his desire to treat her like a possession rather than a person. When he gets a moment of freedom under the mountain he attempts to have sex with Feyre (his wants) instead of trying to escape with or save her (her needs). When Feyre is dying, he can only bring himself to beg for her life, he isn't moved into action. All of these things hint that Tamlin is not a good fit for Feyre. Many readers will not like to read about an H that is so lacking/ ill-fitted. The beautiful part is that these things are only ever hinted at in the writing, not outright stated so you will want to root for Tamlin while also feeling something inexplicably lacking in him. I thought about it lots before I picked up book 2, where my thoughts regarding Tamlin were cemented. Tamlin could not have been written more likeable though. If he was the perfect H then Feyre falling for Rhys in book 2 would have felt like a betrayal, instead of fated, and then Feyre would've been worse than unlikable but detestable as an h.

Lucian:
A secondary character who is both interesting and flawed. He hates Feyre at first, but ultimately warms up to her. He is loyal to a fault, siding with Tamlin over and again, even when he thinks it is wrong to do so. A trait that becomes more obvious as the series progresses. Lucian has potential.

Rhysand (villain/other H):
Rhysand was the most interesting character in the book (although Nesta was a close second). Rhys was the evil queen's right-hand man. He has done terrible things. Yet, when we meet him (not my favorite bit of the book because of the gross circumstances I do not favor, as mentioned above) there is evidence that he is not all that he seems. He appeared to be interested in Feyre romantically, but the &#34;why&#34; part is not there. Also, it is not 100% certain WHAT drives his actions. He is a mystery. Why did he decide to help her time and again? Why, if he likes her did he decide to put her through nightly humiliation? Why use her to torment Tamlin? He is clearly not 100% a good guy. He is complex.

Other things people often talk about:
The sex. There is a lot more sex in this book than in other &#34;YA&#34; books. It seems like that has somehow lead to some amount of controversy. I find that notion very strange as many eons ago when I was a teen, sex was a big part of being a teen- whether or not to have it, who had it, when they had it where and how, what type of birth control to use, etc. Suggestions that a book would have any type of influence on those things are just silly. Teens have sex. It's a fact. Wishing it otherwise does nothing productive. Also, the sex in this series is not &#34;explicit.&#34; Every time I see this adjective used, it makes me laugh. I have read many romances and even some erotica. If you truly want something &#34;explicit&#34; check out erotica- phrases like &#34;the apex of my thighs&#34; or the &#34;the length of him&#34; are not &#34;explicit.&#34;
The copious dialogue. Lots of readers don't like the extended dialogue and also wish to have seen more of the fae world. I am just guessing here, but I am thinking that they are meaning that they wanted less talk and more fairy magic. But, fae are known for more than just their magic. Another key attribute of fae has to do with their words- being able to only speak in rhyme, only speak the truth, answer any question posed, etc. This attribute can be very interesting (see Mortal Instruments series or Dresden Files). And indeed it was put to use throughout the series, sometimes well done other times much too dues ex machina for my liking. Dialogue can be a type of action when done well enough. In this book, it probably could've been better but was good enough for me.

The Fire Night and rape culture. Honestly, I am bothered by this one. I am never fond of rape or sexual violence as a plot device which is why I tend to avoid historical romances almost entirely. In this book, I think the Fire Nite ritual was used in part explain a bit about fae magic and in part to push forward the Feyre-Tamlin relationship while introducing Rhys. I think it both went too far and not far enough. Tamlin's participation cheapens his feelings toward Feyre, just imagine someone saying, &#34;I love you, truly, but I need to go have sex with someone else.&#34; And then he came back to Feyre AFTER HAVING SEX WITH SOMEONE ELSE, and bit her to clearly show his possession of her. It doesn't sit well, does it? Additionally, the three fae with bad intentions suggest to Feyre that fae tradition gives them the right to violate her just because she is present. That makes all fae seem brutal and detestable. Thus, it goes too far. But, what about the converse? The Fire Night ritual is supposed to be necessary to ensure the bounty of the land for the next year. But, the spring court is the only court that has/ observes this ritual en mass? That does not really make sense to me. The need for this ritual, especially considering mated bonds are a rare and extremely valued thing, is not properly explained. It really could've been omitted from the book and is one of the few things about the book that I truly did not like.
The masks. Some people like them, some don't. The reason given for them was that they were yet another obstacle to a human girl falling in love with Tamlin. I really didn't mind them but I did not like Feyre's reaction to the removal of the masks. While it was consistent with her character (she always had an eye for pretty guys), I thought that it cheapened her character to have her feel relieved that Tamlin was so pretty without his mask. It was very superficial, and further proof that there wasn't much of substance to their &#34;love.&#34;

While book 1 is my least favorite of the series, I still really liked it and will definitely re-read it again. Books 2 and 3 get even better and I am looking forward to further writings as well. Hopefully we will get to see what happens to Nesta, Elaine, the 6th queen, and Bryaxis.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RMKJG4KVVSZZG,Elisa,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/b9cf299a-5129-4d7d-89d3-a2234d9a9951._CR9,0,582,582_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on October 2, 2017",True,244 people found this helpful,B00OZP5VRS,,,
415,R23L305CH2KCNJ,Bow Down to the Queen of YA Fantasy,"This book, with its magic, fairytale roots, and steamy hot romance, deserves ALL of the stars.  I loved it!

Here are the five reasons why I gave A Court of Thorns and Roses 5 out of 5 stars (and then some):

‚òÖ FAIRYTALE RETELLING
I was a little wary of this story when I discovered that it was a fairytale retelling.  I love the story of Beauty and the Beast.  Growing up, I watched the Disney version all of the time (but not as much as I watched Pocahontas).  However, in the past I have struggled to find enjoyment in Beauty and the Beast retellings.  Particularly Beastly by Alex Flinn -- I did not enjoy the book or the movie.

I think I was worried that A Court of Thorns and Roses wouldn't feel original, but it was the complete opposite.  Maas has written an incredibly unique story that is grounded in the fairytale we all know and love, but is also independent and utter creative genius (Maas is definitely honing and owning her writing skills!).  Yes, there is a curse, and magic, and a love story.  But there is also dark magic, and steamy romance (and I do mean steamy!), and blood and gore, and court drama -- basically, all of my favorite things wrapped up in one neat, rose-colored bow.

There were some twists on the original story of Beauty and the Beast that I really enjoyed.  For example, in the original story, the residents/servants of the Beast's home are cursed and transformed into household items.  However in ACOTAR, rather than being transformed into household items, Maas' cursed characters must wear masquerade masks, and have done so for 50 years since the curse was placed on the night of a masquerade party.  I also appreciated that, though Tamlin was a beast, that quality did not factor into the curse that was placed on him.  Rather, as a Fae, he has the power of shape-shifting, and takes the form of a beast (usually when fighting).  So, throughout most of the book, Tamlin is portrayed as a glorious, chiseled, man of steel.  Some readers believe that the fact that Tamlin is gorgeous retracts from the Beauty and the &#34;Beast&#34; story line.  However, no one writes hot male love interests like Sarah J. Maas, so I am not complaining about Tamlin at all.

Overall, I found that I loved the fairytale background of this story more than anything.  I enjoyed drawing comparisons between Maas' story and characters, and the story I grew up with.  Maas' world is so intriguing, engrossing you from the very beginning and never letting you go.

‚òÖ GENRE
While we know that ACOTAR is a fairytale retelling, that is not to say that it is a children's book.  I went into this book thinking that it was Young Adult.  However, there is a particular scene that takes place after the Great Rite on Fire Night (such a good scene, by the way -- just wait for it) that made me take a step back and think &#34;Whoa!  This is way too sexy and erotic for Young Adult literature.&#34;

Looking back at Goodreads, I found that the book was listed as Young Adult and New Adult.  But, I would personally classify this book as New Adult.  Having read many New Adult novels, I found that the sex rating for ACOTAR resonates with that of a New Adult novel.  I think that there is a lot of confusion about the genre of this book because we all know Sarah J. Maas as a Young Adult author.  I personally have no problem with this genre.  However, for parents who are giving this book to their young children, or for those readers who don't enjoy sex scenes in their books -- you have been warned.

I love the New Adult genre, and discovering that ACOTAR fell into that genre made me love it even more.  I appreciate the more mature content, and that the characters are closer to my age (Feyre is 19).  And, hey, I appreciate the sexy times, too.  (There is no shame in my game...  Because, who am I kidding?  I have no game.)  I had also never read a New Adult Fantasy before, so I was glad to be exploring new territory.

I'm absolutely impressed with Maas as a writer.  She is not afraid to be different, to venture out to new places.  I love that she is entering this new genre, and look forward to seeing what else she has up her sleeve for the future.

‚òÖ FEYRE, THE PROTAGONIST
When I started reading ACOTAR, I was sure Maas was going to give us another Celaena Sardothien:  a badass girl who is nearly invincible, yet lovable and cool.  However, Feye (pronounced Fay-ruh) is so different from other fantasy protagonists I have read, because she is so unapologetically human.  She is normal, and she is flawed, and I found that I could easily relate to her character.  Feyre is unlike the female protagonists we are accustomed to.  She is no fighter, not outstandingly gorgeous, and she is also illiterate (a shortcoming that embarrasses her to not end).

In the beginning, Feyre is not very likable.  She is cold, harsh, stubborn, and hard-headed.  But, readers begin to see how her situation of poverty has shaped her to be that way.  Once at the Spring Court, where she is no longer burdened with the responsibility of taking care of her father and two sisters (all of whom are ungrateful of her efforts to keep them alive), the ice in her heart begins to melt as she lives in comfort and takes up her passion for painting.  Readers witness her character develop as she begins to rediscover happiness and life's simple pleasures.  Feyre easily becomes a character you can't help but root for and love.

‚òÖ TAMLIN & AN IMPENDING LOVE TRIANGLE
Since we have discussed Feyre, I believe that it is only appropriate to take a glance at her love interest: Tamlin.

Tamlin is a bae Fae warrior, with magical abilities.  He is also gorgeous, kind-hearted, and strong.  And, he places Feyre's happiness and well-being above all else.  But, he is not perfect.  He is flawed, haunted by his family's past, by his own mistakes, and the lives he has taken.  But, through all of that, he still strives to do and be good.

However, I admit that while I love Tamlin, I am worried that Maas has a love triangle in the works for Book 2 of ACOTAR.

Because Rhysand.

Rhys, a sexy, dangerous Fae, is a force of nature who seeks to dig his claws (or rather, talons) into Feyre.  And, I can't say that I hate him.  I actually like his character, although we witness him do some terrible things (even to Feyre).  He seems edgy, fun, and is incredibly witty.  (Maas does this thing where she makes you fall in love with all of her characters, even the morally ambiguous ones.)  While Tamlin is all gorgeous and good, Rhys has that hot-but-tragic thing going for him.

I am already struggling with the love square Maas has going on in the Throne of Glass series (between Celaena and her three love interests -- Chaol, Dorian, and Rowan).  I don't think that I will be able to handle the emotional roller coaster of another of her love triangles.  But, I think that as long as no one else is introduced, as long as this does not move into the quadrilateral stage, everything will be fine.

‚òÖ SUPPORTING CHARACTERS
While Maas' main characters are at the center of attention, her supporting characters keep this book afloat.  With less focus and fewer appearances, Maas' supporting characters still manage to steal our hearts and the show.

First, there is Lucien, the red-haired, one-eyed Fae who is Tamlin's best friend.  He is initially rude to Feyre, but eventually warms up to her.  They easily develop a sort of big-brother-little-sister relationship.  I would consider Lucien to be the story's comic relief.  He is humorous and sarcastic and I adore his character.

There is also Amarantha, the story's evil villainess.  She is a Fae ruler who has a particular hatred for humans, which is not good for Feyre.  She is cold, calculating, and cruel.  But she has a backstory (all the best villains have backstories).  And, I don't want to spoil you all, so I will just say that, when you learn her backstory, you realize why Amarantha is so harsh and unforgiving.  Although, while I can sympathize with her on some level,  I find her evil ways to be too much at times.  However, I still find her to be an interesting, well-written character.

And of course, there is Rhysand, whom I mentioned earlier.  He is incredibly important to the story of Book 1, and will have an even larger presence in Book 2.  I cannot wait to learn more about his character, because he is so enigmatic and intriguing and I just know that I am going to love him.

HONORABLE MENTIONS
Maas' Writing
I believe that ACOTAR is Maas' at her best.  As I stated earlier, we are definitely seeing Maas hone and perfect her skill -- each book she releases is always better than the last.  What I liked most about Maas' writing in ACOTAR was her use of first person.  Throne of Glass is written in third person, and with changing character perspectives.  I find that I can tend to get bored with certain characters.  But, with ACOTAR, told from Feyre's perspective, I felt engaged throughout the entire book.

Faerie World
I literally want to live in Prythian, in the world of the Fae that exists beyond The Wall (just without all of the drama).  Maas depicts the Spring Court so beautifully and vividly.  It seems like a literal heaven on earth.

Other than the beauty of the Fae world, there are the parties and festivities.  I mentioned Fire Night and the Great Rite earlier, two very interesting festivities held in the Fae world.  And then there are parties and gatherings celebrating the seasons, such as Summer Solstice and Midsummer.  It is all so fantastical and fun, readers are just dying to step into the pages.

***

416,R21N6BP3JRKK8,The Miraculous Work of S.E Hinton: The Outsiders,"Growing up is difficult. The desire to fit in is pitted against the encouragement to be unique and different. A person‚Äôs actions as well as the influence of family, friends, and society helps to form a person‚Äôs identity. And, this isn‚Äôt all kids need to worry about: they will face and deal with bumps in the road and times where they‚Äôre down. Ponyboy in The Outsiders thinks his life is figured out, until one night his world is flipped upside down. S. E. Hinton thoughtfully crafted The Outsiders out of her own experiences. A story written in 1965 is still relevant today and captivates the reader with a youthful, slangy writing style which allows the reader to bond with the characters.

The Outsiders, written in 1965 Oklahoma, displays the struggle between two gangs in a town. The narrator, Ponyboy Curtis, his brothers, and friends make up the Greasers. This rag tag group of impoverished guys stick by each other's sides no matter what. They are up against the rich, snooty, Socs. These guys drive around in their expensive cars and jump Greasers to appear cool and intimidate them. In a constant battle between the Socs and Greasers, Ponyboy Curtis discovers there is good and bad in everyone.

The story displays a conflict between two gangs who think they are very different: ‚ÄúGreasers are almost like hoods; we steal things and drive old souped-up cars and hold up gas stations and have a gang fight once in a while‚Äù (3). On the other hand, ‚Äú[Socs] jump greasers and wreck houses and throw beer blasts for kicks and get editorials in the paper for being  a public disgrace one day and an asset to society the next‚Äù (3). It isn‚Äôt safe for a Greaser to walk around alone, for the Socs always pull up in their convertible, hop out, and jump them. The Greasers despise the Socs and the Socs despise the Greasers. This is the case for Ponyboy too until he meets Cherry, the toughest Soc‚Äôs girlfriend, he realizes that Socs aren‚Äôt all that different after all. Cherry and Ponyboy share many similarities, especially their love for sunsets. With the help of Cherry, Ponyboy realizes the greasers, including himself, misjudged the Socs. Yes, they do get drunk and beat up Greasers for no good reason, but they are human and they have lives outside of how well they can fight. Will Ponyboy get everyone else to see the Socs true colors? Can this ever get better? The conflict remains relevant to society fifty years after it was written because there always seems to be this in-group and out-group.

Not only is the story relevant to society, but it also maintains a young, slangy tone that allows the reader to connect with the characters. S. E. Hinton commented that ‚Äúthese characters are really kind of universal without losing their individuality.‚Äù The story, written when the author was only fifteen years old, is told from Ponyboy‚Äôs perspective. Ponyboy is a fourteen year old kid living with his two older brothers, Darry and Sodapop. Sodapop is sixteen and Darry is twenty and has custody of Sodapop and Ponyboy since their parents died in a car crash. Ponyboy‚Äôs young and optimistic, so his narration draws the reader in. Initially, Ponyboy feels very self-conscious and vulnerable: ‚ÄúI was wishing I looked like Paul Newman- he looks tough and I don‚Äôt‚Äù (1) He‚Äôs the youngest of the gang and looks up to his older, tougher brothers and friends. Within the first few pages, Ponyboy walks home from the movie theater alone and is stopped by Socs. ‚ÄúNeed a haircut, greaser?‚Äù they ask him, ‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you like that haircut to begin just below the chin?‚Äù(5) His brothers find him, fight back and save him. In Darry and Sodapop‚Äôs eyes Ponyboy is still young and fragile. But, as the story advances Ponyboy fights hard to prove the gang wrong. He grows stronger as he learns to be courageous, defend himself, and later in the process meets death face to face. S.E Hinton said ‚ÄúWhen I write, an interesting transformation takes place. I go from thinking about my narrator to being him,‚Äù and this is also how I felt while reading this.  Ponyboy is forced to grow up in order to fit in, and as this happens the reader gets to grow with him and see him both thrive and grieve.

 With help from family and friends, growing up can be much more manageable and even fun. When reading The Outsiders I could never put the book down. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone looking for an easy read with a timeless story and a powerful message.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R21N6BP3JRKK8,magentacat,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on October 31, 2017",True,48 people found this helpful,014240733X,,,

Now, I had to read it back when I was in 6th grade, so I totally understand it. I knew that this would be a great gift. And I was 100% right!
Since she got it Christmas morning, she has now read it at least 7 more times! All of the pages are well printed and clear. The cover art is really cool too.

419,R2A9A1XD8Y2EU9,Such a great book!,"Everyone is probably well aware of the coming of age classic, The Outsiders by S.E. Hinton. Since its publication in 1967, it has become an iconic classic. It became a beloved classic film in 1983 which starred relatively unknown actors but who became household names. Actors like C. Thomas Howell, Ralph Macchino, Patrick Swayze and so many more. The New York Times stated, ‚ÄúThe Outsiders transformed young-adult fiction from a genre mostly about prom queens, football players and high school crushes to one that portrayed a darker, truer world."" I first read The Outsiders in 7th grade and it was the first time I read a book to analyze themes and messages. It was the first book which has stuck with me even thirty years laters! Recently, I reread The Outsiders and I was immediately transported back to the 7th grade and recaptured my love for this beautiful story.
It is a beloved story of heroism, friendship and belonging. No one said life was easy but 14-year old Ponyboy Crutis is confident he has it figured out. He knows he can count on his older brothers, Darry and Sodapop. He knows he can count on his friends, true friends who would have his back for anything. He also knows he can count on trouble with the Socs, the gang of rich kids who take pleasure in beating up the ‚Äúgreasers‚Äù like Ponyboy and his friends. One night, after an innocent interaction with two Soc girls, the tension rises and turns deadly leaving one Soc dead and Ponyboy and his friend, Johnny, running for their lives. Convinced their version of events would not be believed, the boys go into hiding until an act of heroism brings them in the limelight. Ponyboy must learn that life isn‚Äôt always greener on the other side.
The Outsiders is gritty, dramatic and remains as powerful today as it was when it was first published. It laid the groundwork for the Young Adult genre. S.E. Hinton wrote this story when she was 15 years old after she witnessed her friend get jumped by rich kids. The Outsiders was and is a controversial book and it is challenged and debated today. It was ranked #38 on the American Library Association‚Äôs Top 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of the 1990s. It has been banned for the portrayal of gang violence, underage drinking and smoking, and family dysfunction. However, the book is still a part of the curriculum at the middle and high school levels in the US schools. I look forward to introducing my daughters to this beautiful story. If you have never read The Outsiders, I highly, highly, highly recommend it! Then I recommend watching the film.

443,RRH4E24CVQ374,A Must-Read for West Wing Fans and Anyone Who Believes in the Power of Service,"What‚Äôs Next is a treasure trove for fans of ""The West Wing"" and anyone interested in the intersection of television, politics, and public service. This book is more than just a behind-the-scenes look at a beloved series; it‚Äôs a deep dive into the heart and soul of what made ""The West Wing"" a cultural phenomenon in the late 90s and early 2000s.

Melissa Fitzgerald and Mary McCormack take readers on an intimate journey back to President Bartlet‚Äôs Oval Office, offering untold stories and fresh commentary that even the most devoted fans will find surprising and delightful. The book beautifully captures the camaraderie among the cast and crew, the dedication to creating a show that stood for decency and honor, and the lasting impact it has had on American culture and civic life.

The insights into the show's creation and the relationships formed on set are both poignant and entertaining, providing a new perspective on TWW episodes. Moreover, the book‚Äôs exploration of the show‚Äôs legacy, especially its commitment to service and competent leadership, resonates deeply in today‚Äôs world.

What‚Äôs Next is not just a book for ""West Wing"" aficionados‚Äîit‚Äôs for anyone who believes in the power of storytelling to inspire real change. Fitzgerald and McCormack have crafted a moving tribute to a show that continues to inspire hope and optimism, encouraging a service-oriented mindset.

453,R2Z2MSM4Q09YMQ,Insightful book,"In the 21st century, when we believe that everything is evolving around us and that all countries are moving forward, we realize that there is still a parasite which it is difficult to get rid of.
Countries that had the opportunity to evolve, have had to pass a difficult test of not falling into totalitarianism and ambition. Such was the case of some countries of the Soviet Union that achieved liberation, but still others continue to fall into the same abyss from which they can't rise, or don't want to, since that parasite has crawled in the mind of their crowd, as did happen in North Korea, China, etc.
Animal Farm shows the perfect example of how the unhealthy idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa cheap Socialism began to take root to become a dictatorial Communism, as it happens in Venezuela today. Its strange end leaves a bitter taste that perhaps the writer did on purpose to open the consciousness of future generations. An open ending that forces the reader to ask himself: what is the solution? And how will it end?
Through human experiences of the animals of this farm, we can identify this truth that still lingers in some shady societies of the present. The solution is in our hands. It will depend on the degree of preparation, culture, moral values, determination, and courage people have to free their homeland and achieve a better future. Remember governments must fear the people and not the opposite.
After that, I summarize my point of view about the strongest references dealt with through the characters in this book (that can be easily identify and distinguished when you start to read the story) in the following sections:
1) Leaders full of charisma who manage to enter the hearts of the crowd by their power of conviction. They choose the most insecure sectors and people to whom they inject large doses of false trust and dependence, and then use them in the propagation of their miserable revolution.
2) From the beginning, they call a supposed self-identification and self-recognition through rhythmic and flattering slogans. They remember again and again their few and poor achievements that remain in the distant past. Then, they impose a barrier of differences between them and the supposed enemy. In this way, the people is infused with a nationalism that is based on ignorance, fear, and blind reverence, forcing them to repeat proverbs and apply reforms without understanding the true meaning or purpose, thus beginning to resemble a herd of sheep, marching pleased towards the slaughterhouse.
3) They make the crowd believe that they have the final decision and, for the common good, unconsciously follow the rules and imposed parameters. In addition, some extra benefits are allowed to those who follow and protect the regime indulgently. This is how they teach the majority that it is better to be corrupt, dishonest, and negligent, in order to achieve higher ranks.
4) The regime feel entitled to legalize and abolish what suits it, ordering the people what to eat, how to dress, greet and live, and what to learn, while they live freely at the expense of the efforts of others and of the injustices committed, trampling the honor of an entire country and their own Machiavellian socialist laws.
5) What seemed a worthy plan for community, social, intellectual, and economic development, now shows the true intention that tries to kill the spirit of solidarity to impose the dictatorial and even genocidal plan, if the regressive revolution warrants it.
6) Everyone, even the majority of the crowd, realize that revolutionary projects are a total failure when they find themselves amidst of aberrant poverty.
7) When they want to discredit an opponent or other progressive ideas, they use their famous method of defamation with lies, intimidation, and any other means. For them, the aim (maintain / save the revolution) justifies the means (spreading false rumors, prosecutions, torture, hunger, espionage), importing in the least the opinion of others, since their own people live in ignorance, cowardice and/or conformism.
8) To finally protect their interests and ideals, communists surround themselves with and associate with allies of their own class: corrupt, traffickers, murderers and terrorists, and expand their power further through the destruction of every vital block of a society , from its financial structure to public sectors, such as health, without caring about the misery that people live. To rule the ignorant and negligent is much easier.
9) There comes a time when the revolutionary-communist doctrine is so deeply rooted in the consciences, that the people forget how well they lived before. The most outrageous thing is that there are still people who support such regimes and whose can mental programming is so easily influenced on behalf the sadistic needs and convenience of these cunning and malevolent rulers.

454,RKCQ4PFLZ8296,The Road to Hell is Paved with Good Intentions; Power Corrupts,"Thanks to finishing ANIMAL FARM, I have now read all of Orwell‚Äôs fiction.  Of course, 1984 is my favorite, and by far the most profound.  But I really like KEEP THE ASPIDISTRA FLYING (which was the most moving) and A CLERGYMAN‚ÄôS DAUGHTER, both of which show the influence of Somerset Maugham.  COMING UP FOR AIR I found a piece of bittersweet nostalgia.  BURMESE DAYS was just bitter.  So where does ANIMAL FARM fit in?  It was Orwell‚Äôs last work of fiction and I would call it a heavy-handed allegory. This does not mean that I was not entertained by it.  But I was always aware that he was preaching.  In this case, he was preaching to the choir.  I agree with him all down the line.  Of course I see the parallels to our current society; that‚Äôs pretty transparent.

I also think this book has been more influential on modern literature than is generally acknowledged.  There are many striking parallels to William Golding‚Äôs LORD OF THE FLIES.  I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs coincidental that Golding‚Äôs ‚ÄúPiggy‚Äù is a close cousin to Orwell‚Äôs ‚ÄúSnowball.‚Äù

This perhaps is an exaggeration, but it seems to me that by the 21st Century, (as a companion piece to 1984) this book had become one of the key texts of a Western education.  It is constantly referenced.  It‚Äôs a must-read.  It‚Äôs also very brief",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKCQ4PFLZ8296,krebsman,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on May 6, 2024",True,3 people found this helpful,0451526341,,,
455,R188QQDY0HWPMB,"A brilliant, heedful, and harrowing read that stabbed my brain","As with most readers, my intro to George Orwell came by way of Nineteen Eighty-Four. The novel remains a dystopian masterpiece by which all others are measured. It birthed an entire genre and coined the ‚ÄúOrwellian‚Äù adjective, used to describe ideas that are uniquely corrosive to society. Its influence can be seen in countless titles, everything from The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale to The Hunger Games.

Nineteen Eighty-Four is a haunting tale of totalitarian overreach. It‚Äôs very hard to read, but not because of challenging prose. Rather, it carries an uncomfortable realness and familiarity. The ongoing ails of society are trapped within its pages. The lessons are disturbing, necessary, and leave you with a looming sense of dread that is impossible to shake.

Thus, a general rule for reading more Orwell is ‚ÄúDid you like Nineteen Eighty-Four?‚Äù

In answering the question for myself, the term ‚Äúlike‚Äù might be a tad anemic. Orwell painted with words and few can match his prose, so ‚Äúappreciate‚Äù sounds better since it‚Äôs damn near impossible to ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù Nineteen Eighty-Four. But yes, once the mind-melting horror had faded from my conscience, I was ready to explore the next Orwellian nightmare.

For most, that takes the form of Animal Farm.

This is a short novella written as a satirical fable, the premise of which is deceptively simple. The animals of a poorly run farm decide to rebel. They drive out the human owner and take over operations, with the goal of creating an animal utopia. Sounds cute, right? But then you learn that Orwell mirrored the story on the events that sparked the Russian Revolution and rise of Stalin. It goes about as well as you‚Äôd think.

From an educational standpoint, Animal Farm does something truly remarkable. It teaches us about the perils of dictatorships in a short parable about rebellious livestock. We learn, in no uncertain terms, just how easy it is to manipulate good intent. In the immortal words of Ron Burgundy, ‚ÄúThat escalated quickly.‚Äù Orwell knew how to twist a stomach, and this frightening novella is another shining example.

So, did I ‚Äúlike‚Äù Animal Farm? Not particularly.

464,RY035INOAKCR3,Overlooked,"I use the headline ""overlooked"" for this review because that's the word that comes to my mind as I read this book.  As someone born after the Vietnam war, I had no idea how harshly and often the women who'd served in Vietnam had been overlooked once they returned from their tours.  So many times in this book our heroine searches for help in what are supposed to be support groups, but she's summarily dismissed because she's a woman and ""there were no women in the war.""  This makes me so sad, and I had no idea that women who served in Vietnam suffered from many of the same issues as the men.  I've hardly been able to turn my thoughts away from this book, and I'm so glad I read it.  I appreciate Kristin Hannah for writing this book so we can all read it and learn from the mistakes in our past.  I would recommend this book to anyone, male or female.  It's a fabulously written, heart breaking story.

465,RUPH8SWGKKYFH,A Riveting Tale of Courage and Change,"In her latest masterpiece, ‚ÄúThe Women,‚Äù Kristin Hannah once again proves her prowess in weaving narratives that resonate deeply with the human spirit. Known for her powerful storytelling in acclaimed works like ‚ÄúThe Nightingale‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Four Winds,‚Äù Hannah embarks on an ambitious journey through the tumultuous era of the 1960s, presenting an intimate yet expansive portrait of a nation at the brink of transformation.

At the heart of this novel is Frances ""Frankie"" McGrath, a character whose development from a sheltered, idealistic nursing student into a battle-hardened Army nurse symbolizes the tumultuous era she inhabits. Frankie‚Äôs journey is a revelation, a testament to the untold stories of women who dared to step into the fray of conflict, challenging the societal norms of their time. The transformation she undergoes, fueled by the stark realities of the Vietnam War, is written with such authenticity and emotional depth that you cannot help but feel intimately connected to her struggles, triumphs, and inevitable moments of despair.

‚ÄúThe Women‚Äù is not just Frankie‚Äôs story; it is an ode to the countless women who, like her, ventured into the heart of darkness, armed with little more than their courage and a steadfast commitment to healing. Hannah‚Äôs portrayal of war‚Äôs chaos, the bonds forged and broken in the crucible of conflict, and the arduous journey of reintegration into a society that seems to have moved on without them is both heart-wrenching and enlightening.

What sets this novel apart is Hannah‚Äôs ability to capture the essence of an era‚Äîthe music, the mood, the whirlwind of social change‚Äîand distill it through the experiences of her characters. Frankie‚Äôs return home to a divided America, her struggle to reconcile the person she has become with the nation she thought she knew, is a powerful commentary on the cost of war and the resilience of the human spirit.

While ‚ÄúThe Women‚Äù is undeniably a work of fiction, its roots in the real-life experiences of female veterans lend it a compelling authenticity. Hannah‚Äôs meticulous research and her compassionate storytelling ensure that the novel is not only a tribute to the women of Vietnam but to all women who have faced the horrors of war with unwavering bravery.

In giving ‚ÄúThe Women‚Äù a four-star rating, I (a female US Army veteran myself) do so with the utmost respect for Kristin Hannah‚Äôs craftsmanship and her dedication to shedding light on the often-overlooked contributions of women in war. If there is any critique to be had, it lies in wanting more‚Äîthe novel, at times, leaves the reader yearning for deeper explorations into the lives of its secondary characters, each of whom could easily be the protagonist of their own compelling tale.

Ultimately, ‚ÄúThe Women‚Äù is a profound, moving novel that not only entertains but enlightens, reminding us of the enduring strength of the human spirit in the face of adversity. It is a must-read for fans of historical fiction and for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of a pivotal moment in American history through the eyes of those who lived it.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUPH8SWGKKYFH,Jill Hinton Wolfe,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/aed46289-1914-4293-8328-f0ce08b929a1._CR61,0,169,169_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2024",True,122 people found this helpful,B0C4QD5VPB,,,
466,R1C3VQP8SKA783,Men can admire women who served too,"I am a fan of Kristin Hanna‚Äôs books, especially Nightingale. I enjoyed The Women for several reasons. First, the Vietnam War was my generation‚Äôs war. I was in elementary school when it started. By the time I finished high school it was the apex point.

I come from a WWII family. My father was a crew member on a B17. Think Master‚Äôs of the Air and you have an idea of his war time experiences. I can still hear my dad talk about the war but not frequently. With the Vietnam War raging and our being able to view the situation on the TV, my dad would tear up as he thought about the young men in battle.

By the time I finished college the war was near it's end. I lost friends in Vietnam and I feel some guilt in having not served. I am glad my friends and so many others had the tender loving care of dedicated nurses who served so bravely.

Second, Kristin Hannah has done a real service to all the underappreciated women who did their best to save lives. We owe much to this author‚Äôs attempt to honor these gallant women.

I gave this book five stars because of the unique nature of the work. Also, the writing is so well done. From a man‚Äôs point of view there have been too many soap opera moments in the book but I am reminded that the primary audience would be women. However, to paraphrase ‚Äúwomen can be heroes too‚Äù. Men can be admirers of the dedication of women serving in combat zones too. These women paved the way for two generations of women who fought in our nation‚Äôs wars. We are all in their debt.

468,R2B6C5BK2SWQNE,Captivating Journey about Women Serving in Vietnam,"""The Women"" tells the story of a young woman named Frankie and her experiences during and after the Vietnam War. Through Frankie's eyes, we see the bravery of the men and women who served in the war and learn about the hard times they faced when they came back to an unwelcoming America.

The first part of the book takes us to Vietnam, showing the strong bonds and sacrifices on the battlefield. The second part of the book is just as exciting, as we follow Frankie's return home and see how she deals with the many challenges she faces.

The author does a great job of creating deep and complex relationships between Frankie, her parents, other women who served, and her romantic partners. These relationships add depth to the story, making it not just about war, but also about human connection and finding acceptance.

469,R1YHF60GQ3BYRE,"Absolutely amazing! An easily, well deserved 5 star read!","Kristin Hannah is back, baby!!! In a world where The Nightingale is numero uno I am here to tell you The Women gives it a run for its money!

What an emotional rollercoaster ride! In true Hannah fashion, she rips your heart apart and mends it back together but with this one she did it to me several times. In a span of two pages, mine was pieced together just to be shattered again. But the ending. Oh my goodness. That ending. ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è

Historical fiction has always been a favorite of mine, but the last year or so I haven't really focused on it. I knew when I saw this book releasing I was going to read it and with the high praise I saw right off the bat even before its release, I had a feeling I, too, was going to love it. But I also was hesitant, because Historical Fiction hasn't been my go to lately. It can seem daunting to me at times. They are usually based on true stories and real people, so you know it is going to be an emotional ride. You just don't know if you are ready to embark on that journey or not. If you know what I am talking about or have felt similar, I am here to tell you, do not let that hold you back on reading this book! This book has the emotions of a romance novel, the edge of your seat tension like a thriller, and it is an absolutely must read for everyone! Please don't let this one pass you by. Even if historical fiction is not your normal go to genre, I promise this one is worth it!

Hannah's writing is something magical. You are immediately hooked and transported to this world she has created on page one. In our world of reading books, there are good writers, there are bad writers, and then there are phenomenal writers. And Kristin Hannah, my friends, is a phenomenal writer!! When you read her books, you are seeing the words play out inside your head so easily, you feel like you are watching a movie. She is cinematic and that is how I know this book is going to translate so well to screen. How can it not with the foundation she has provided them?? (Yes, Warner Bros. has picked this up for a film! üôå)

So many HF novels focus on WWII. I love those books just as much as the next person, but it is so refreshing to get a different time period, especially from a queen like Hannah. I know nothing of the Vietnam War. I do remember seeing footage of how some people reacted and their opinions of the war, but not to the depths this book takes you on. Or how women were treated that were veterans in this war. That was eye-opening and heart wrenching, but sadly not surprising.

Yes, this felt personally for me. As a nurse and a former ICU nurse, I love when we get a protagonist that is also in my field. But this book gutted me and made it feel like Hannah personally dug deep into my soul and stirred up feelings I had buried down deep with this one. I was wrecked. Like sitting in a Mexican restaurant with people all around with tears streaming down my face wrecked while reading this book. I can't tell you the last time a book emotionally wrecked me like this one did. Now I am not saying everyone will have that visceral reaction. In fact most probably won't,  but I am just telling you that is the response this book got from me. üòÖ As usual, I went in blind not knowing what this book was about. I saw high praise and great feedback so I was excited, but like I said earlier I wasn't expecting this response from reading it.

If you'd like to know a short synopsis of the book, it centers around a combat nurse, Frankie, who as recently graduated from nursing school, and despite her parents' protests and disappointment she has joined the Army to assist as a combat nurse in the Vietnam War. You watch Frankie transform from a naive, young girl who is in way over her head into a straight rockstar and that is something I think everyone in our field can relate to despite all of us not being in a similar predicament she is in.

It is divided into two parts. Frankie's experience during the war and when she comes home. That was another unique take that I appreciated from the author. So many books stay in the combat part of war. Rarely have I read one where you go with the protagonist when they come back home and deal with the ""After"" part. There are some triggers, so if you want to know more about those feel free to reach out!

I've never read a book centered around the Vietnam War, so I am extremely grateful Hannah chose this time period to write this amazing novel. And if you haven't gathered it already, I highly recommend this book for everyone. You are simply doing yourself a disservice if you skip over it. Period.

470,R1ZI3SBUTTT7PH,Brave Women,"America has always portrayed itself as a country of advanced thinking, but the truth under its boasting is that , for the most part,  if women were a reason to be proud, America ignored them.  Hannah reveals this ""critical gender theory"" in her book about a nurse serving in Vietnam. Her main character is Frankie McGrath , a young woman  who becomes an Army nurse in Vietnam. She believes she should serve her country in some way  after her brother is killed in the war shortly after he enlists.  She is hoping her mother and most importantly, her father will be proud of her. She gets the exact opposite reaction. They expected her to get married and have children.  Her father has a ""hero's wall"" of family members who served in  past wars. She can only be on that wall after she gets married, and the picture is her wedding picture, and it will be the only picture of her.  The wall is symbolic of what society deemed  was heroic  and only men could be heroic in that way.  There was only room for a woman if  she married, became a housewife, and had children. While this choice is perfectly  acceptable, it should not be perfectly binding as the only way for a woman to show her worth.  Frankie is sure she belongs on that wall as a nurse who serves in  the Army. Her parents disagree and tell their friends , when Frankie goes off to the war, thst she is studying abroad.  But it isn't just her family whose narrow vision of Frankie affects her life.  The Army itself has allowed societal rules to dictate how women are treated. Getting to Vietnam is no picnic for Frankie. While her fellow travelers are all men dressed in comfortable fatigues, she must travel in her blouse, tight green jacket, narrow, skirt, nylons held up by a regulation girdle (despite panty hose being available) , and heels.  The life of a nurse in a war zone is dangerous, frightening, and traumatic.  The war makes less and less sense to Frankie as she stuffs vital organs back into shredded chests and abdominal cavities, and helps doctors amputate more than one limb per patient. Frankie comes to realize  with growing horror what is really going on in Vietnam, that America was losing that war, but didn't mind sacrificing more and more young men so that the government could save face.  It is a rude awakening for her. When she returns home after two tours of duty, she is treated with disrespect by the public, the VA, and her parents. The country had been told that no women went to Vietnam, so Frankie could not have been there even though she so obviously was. That has always been the problem with woman who don't follow the rules society dictates. If they insist on showing how wrong headed that thinking is, society will just have to minimize them if not ignore them.  Suffering from what is now  recognized as PTSD, Frankie hits rock bottom before she is able, with the help of her nurse friends who also served, to find a way to survive.  The Vietnam protests by the veterans themselves as well as everyone else who  raised their voices,  finally ended the war.  Eventually, the government admitted that over 6,000 nurses,most of them women,  served in Vietnam.  Hannah's story is thoroughly researched.  Her depiction of war torn Vietnam is riveting.  One turns the pages to end the war as soon as possible.  Frankie's struggles with  the war and at home are realistic, heartbreaking,  and deeply troubling, but they don't destroy her.  She survived Vietnam, and she survives coming back home.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZI3SBUTTT7PH,Lynn Young,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on June 10, 2024",True,13 people found this helpful,B0C4QD5VPB,,,
471,R2C0M1IEV40661,The Smell of Perfume,"Review of ‚ÄúThe Women‚Äù
By Kristen Hannah

Suddenly, a beautiful woman walks by you see her, you‚Äôll never forget her, and you can still smell her perfume years later. It‚Äôs the smell of her perfume that brings her back time and time again.
I thought long and hard about reading this book and after I read it, how do I review it?  It‚Äôs one of those Kindle suggested books. The title of the book didn‚Äôt get my attention, but it was the picture of the palm trees and the UH-1 Huey helicopter that made me look closer.
Vietnam nurses were a gift from God, and they sadly suffered trauma every single day. I still get emotional when I think of them and their care for the wounded and dying warriors.
I know this book is fictional, but it sent me back to a place long ago. I‚Äôm a Vietnam Vet. When Kristen Hannah wrote of Franke and Barb being transferred to the 71st Evac Hospital in Pleiku and the wounded coming in from Dak‚Äôto in November of 1967, she was writing about my unit, the 173rd Airborne Brigade.
I was there at the time of the ‚ÄúBattle of the Slopes‚Äù June 20-23, 1967. I left Vietnam and went home to the ‚Äúworld‚Äù in September of 1967. The battle of Dak‚Äôto and the battle for Hill 875 happened in November of 1967. On Hill 875 there were 115 KIA, 253 wounded, 7 MIA, and 6 UH-1 Huey helicopters shot down. PFC Carlos Lozada was KIA and received the Medal of Honor. Chaplain Major Charles J. Watters was KIA and received the Medal of Honor also. I flew many times with Chaplain Watters, he was always with his men.
You can find their names on ‚ÄúThe Wall‚Äù in Washington DC. Chaplain Watters is on Panel 30E row 036. PFC Carlos Lozada is on Panel 30E, Row 045. There are 510 names on Panel 30E.
You can also find Jack Lee Croxdale II on Panel 30E, Row 23. Jack was a first day KIA. He got to Dak‚Äôto with 173rd Airborne on November 19, 1967 and he was killed on November 19, 1967, the day he arrived in Vietnam. His 19th birthday was November 20, 1967. Jack is also one of the seven MIAs. He has a lonely head stone at Fort Rosecrans National Cometary in San Diego, CA that I visit when I can.
I have found that most Vietnam nurses are shy around vets. It‚Äôs possible because we vets get emotional around them or we bring back too many memories.
My wife and I visited a church a while ago with my cousin on Veterans Day and Memorial Day several times before a woman we had seen often at church finally told us that she was a nurse in Vietnam. I felt blessed that she trusted me enough to finally tell me. I have found that Vietnam nurses are very private people.
I do agree, at times the Veterans Administration can be a nightmare for both women and men veterans.
Finally, I know this is a book of fiction, but there are parts that are taken from real life. Most POWs came home and blended back into society. One in particular did not, and he came back to a wife far different from the one he left behind. He had multiple affairs and ultimately divorced her. Franke‚Äôs story is not too far off the mark.
My daughter is a registered nurse. She just received her master‚Äôs degree in nursing, so she is now able to teach nursing students, just like Franke did with every ‚ÄúNew Be‚Äù. I told my daughter about this book, and she had already heard about the book, and she also knows several nurses who have read it. She‚Äôs excited to read it, along with my wife.
One last thing, two months before I DEROS and I went back to the ‚Äúworld‚Äù I was assigned my replacement, Fred. Fred and I spent the next two months together (24-7) as I taught him my army duties with the 173rd. I was then relocated to the 7th Special Forces Group at Fort Bragg, NC. As men from my unit returned from ‚ÄúNam‚Äù and assigned to Fort Bragg, I‚Äôd ask how Fred was doing and no one wanted to talk about him. Finally, a guy we called ‚ÄúPapa San‚Äù (because he had a lot of kids), told me that Fred had been killed on Hill 875.
Two years later, and after I got out of the service, I was working at a car wash. To my amazement, one day while working, Fred came walking through waiting for his car to be washed. Needless to say, we celebrated Fred‚Äôs coming back from the dead!
After catching up with Fred, he told me that approximately twenty minutes after he had been wounded on Hill 875 and treated by the medics, he was on a helicopter headed for Pleiku and the 71st Evac Hospital.

477,R2KY8XH5PXMTI4,"SPOILER review! TW: Almost Sa, Eating Disorder, Fat Phobic Remarks","My review below does mention briefly about some spoilers, trigger warning wise this one has a almost SA scene, fat phobic remarks, and eating disorders. I may have missed a few trigger warnings, if you‚Äôre interested in reading please google all trigger warnings.

I put off reading this for a while because a lot of people were saying that the second book is better then the first and I have to say that I disagree, Millie‚Äôs character in The Housemaids secret isn‚Äôt as interesting as in The Housemaid. She came off as annoying at times and I just didn‚Äôt care for her character in this book. I didn‚Äôt really enjoy any other character other then Enzo, Enzo is my all time favorite character from this series, I‚Äôm glad he was brought back and I‚Äôm happy we are going to be getting more Enzo content in The Housemaid is watching.

Something‚Äôs that annoyed me about this book is the repetitive way in which Millie says she being watched, I think it pops up like six times, surely their is another way you can say she feels she being watched or show that she is being watched. There are some trigger warnings for this one, a scene where Millie is almost Sa leads to an officer implying that it was because of the way she was dressed (pg 69) during part two of the book there is fat phobic comments and eating disorders.

The romance with Brock feels a little unnecessary until the end but the way that Millie was leading him on all while knowing that she wasn‚Äôt ready for more and still loved Enzo is one of the reasons I didn‚Äôt particularly like her, Enzo leaves to take care of his mother who had declining health and Millie states multiple times that she is mad that he left but it‚Äôs literally his only family.

The mystery/thrilling bits are different from the first story but at the same time they are still kind of similar, the mystery in general while interesting just wasn‚Äôt as hard hitting as the first book, I think I was just expecting a bit more after hearing so many comments about this book, Im hoping Millie‚Äôs character gets redeemed for me in the third book but at least I‚Äôll get some more Enzo content.

485,R1ZSXDBWB8XCQB,Slowing Down to Unlock the Power of Spiritual Discipline,"In his compelling book, ""The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry,"" John Mark Comer presents a powerful case for slowing down and embracing spiritual disciplines as a means to access the transformative power of the Holy Spirit. As a fellow Jesus follower, I found Comer's insights to be both convicting and inspiring, urging me to reevaluate my own priorities and pursue a deeper connection with God.

One of the book's central themes is the idea that spiritual disciplines like prayer and fasting require great intentionality and commitment, but they also unlock a source of power that is otherwise inaccessible to us. Comer argues that by creating space for these practices in our lives, we open ourselves up to the work of the Holy Spirit, who empowers us to live with greater purpose, peace, and spiritual vitality.

This message struck a chord with me, as I have often struggled to maintain a consistent rhythm of spiritual disciplines amidst the demands of my roles as a CEO, dad, and technology enthusiast. Comer's words serve as a timely reminder that neglecting these practices can lead to a sense of disconnection from God and a lack of spiritual power in our lives.

As I reflected on the book's content, I was reminded of Jesus' teaching that some demons can only be cast out through prayer and fasting (Mark 9:29). While Comer does not specifically reference this passage, I believe it affirms the book's underlying premise‚Äîthat there is real spiritual power to be found in the disciplines of prayer and fasting, power that enables us to overcome the challenges and obstacles we face in our lives.

""The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry"" is more than just a call to slow down; it is an invitation to pursue a life of deep intimacy with God and to experience the transformative power of the Holy Spirit. For anyone who has ever felt too busy to prioritize their spiritual growth, this book offers a compelling vision of what is possible when we ruthlessly eliminate hurry and make space for the things that truly matter.

If you are looking for a book that will challenge you to reconsider your priorities, deepen your faith, and experience the power of spiritual discipline in new ways, ""The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry"" is a must-read. Comer's insights and practical guidance will help you cultivate a life marked by greater purpose, peace, and spiritual vitality.

486,R15LGRDSHUGU5R,Hustle is dumb; slowing down is smart,"I very much liked the message of this book. I didn‚Äôt like the execution of providing the message very much. There were good and bad things about both the message and execution, but good ones carried much more weight.
But, I will traditionally start from some‚Ä¶

CONS
1. Jokes.

That‚Äôs the minor CON. Some of them were really lame. Dry like a desert. But some of them cracked me up too. I guess, you cannot win them all, right?

But there is an underlying issue here too. Check out CON #3.

2. Overly Spiritual.
That‚Äôs nitpicking, I know. This is a book written by a pastor for Christians. It should be spiritual and it serves this crowd.

However, I hate the fact that people who need this message the most, luke-warmed Christians and secular people, will miss out on this. The ruthless elimination of hurry helps you become a better human being, not just a better Christian.

I‚Äôm a Christian, and I always try to mix both spiritual and secular tips in my texts, so the majority of the population will not be left out.

On the other hand, I guess none of this makes deep sense if there is not a loving God who knows what‚Äôs good and bad for us. You can go through the motions, but if you don‚Äôt see the meaning, will you even bother to go through the motions?

As I said, pure nitpicking.

3. Language, Please!
But I fully agree with the current top review of The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry on Amazon: the language is dumbed down and this does the book a great disservice. Seriously, I love self-published books for the personal tone and personal stories. But if the personal tone becomes a colloquial one, especially tackling such a serious subject matter‚Ä¶ Ouch.

That severely spoiled my reading experience. Still, I highlighted a lot of passages and devoured the book. It taught me something. It reinforced or articulated a lot of what I already knew. But the sour taste remained.

Definitely, The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry is not a perfect book. But it is a very good one. Here comes the plenty of‚Ä¶

PROS

1. The Origin Story.
For me, it set the stage for the whole book. But the advice from Comer‚Äôs mentor, repeated word by word, when asked about spiritual progress?

Plus, John‚Äôs struggles with keeping his sanity in the hurry of the everyday life made the whole book relatable for me.

It was a perfect way to start the book. Big kudos for that.

2. Sabbath.
I‚Äôm a guy who has been practicing Sabbath for 25 years (since I was 17 years old). I never grasped completely where it comes from. I was simply obedient.
Not zealous; my line of work (IT support of 24/7 systems) demanded attending some emergencies and scheduled maintenance on Sundays. But I always had the gut feeling it‚Äôs extremely important to stick to the Sabbath practice.

Even during my university studies, I must have been really pressed (the final attempt to pass an exam) to study on Sunday. When I had the chance to stray away from the projects that needed occasional work on Sundays, I jumped on it.

However, only by reading The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry did I realize what Sabbath really provides:

  the Sabbath‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääjust like an animal or a human being‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähas the life-giving capacity to procreate.‚Äù

I knew the Ten Commandments by heart, but the Catholic version of the Sabbath commandment (in teaching, not in the Bible) is severely abbreviated: Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy. I never paid attention to the whole placement of the commandment.

What penetrated my awareness was probably quoting the percentages:

  If you were to configure Ten Commandments as a pie chart, this one would take up over 30 percent of the pie.‚Äù

I‚Äôm a numbers freak. I know what they mean, like normal people know what words mean. The third commandment is utterly important. The author‚Äôs line of reasoning convinced me completely. I was ready to accept that the Sabbath is life-giving.

3. The Message.
Like most people nowadays, I stuffed way too many tasks into my days. Almost exactly two years ago, a friend challenged me to dedicate half an hour a day for physical activity.

I had to force myself to carve out those 30 minutes a day. It helped me immensely in keeping a sane mind among the multitude of things I do on a daily basis (writing, coaching, a day job, book advertising business, three masterminds, etc.). It saved my mind when I was in the thick of the COVID-induced brain fog for three months.

Also, around the same time I started tracking my work time. I had been working 4‚Äì6 hours a day (apart from Sundays, of course). And my income didn‚Äôt fluctuate much. Creating time for walks and bike rides also created a mind space for me.

I think this is a good illustration of what eliminating hurry out of your life does. Comparing to most corporate workers, I work at a leisurely pace. And I‚Äôm making more money than my director in PwC who has 60+ people under her chain of command.

I‚Äôm talking money here because that‚Äôs the main illusion in hurry‚Äôs favor‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat by doing more and faster you can have more. Yes, you can, but it‚Äôs not a guarantee. You can have ‚Äúmuch‚Äù by working 4‚Äì6 hours a day.

That‚Äôs just tackling the carnal part of things. When it comes to the spiritual realm, hurry gives zero return. In fact, it‚Äôs a hurdle.

I pray, meditate, read and journal for about two hours a day, and I‚Äôve been doing that for years. This is the sole reason I could hustle for years and didn‚Äôt ever burn out. There were a few occasions where I was close to a breakdown, but I always had space in my days reserved for God and relationships; that saved me.

Oh, and I didn‚Äôt just survive. I made a lot of progress. And that‚Äôs my point. You don‚Äôt need to hurry up to grow. You need to slow down. Comer articulates it aptly in his book.

4. 20 Practices to Slow Down.
That was the best part of the book, in my opinion, because it was the most practical. I‚Äôm a down-to-earth kind of person. Deep philosophical ruminations are fine and good, but if they don‚Äôt translate into concrete daily actions, I just don‚Äôt hold them in high esteem.

The practices John enumerated are clear, precise and taken from his experience. You can take them and apply immediately.

And they are so challenging! Seriously, remember this comes from a guy who spends over 2.5 hours a day on intentional slowing down. I‚Äôm on the same page as the author, yet I found most of those disciplines extremely challenging. Also, several of them apply directly to mobile phones. I thought I made a good job of using my smartphone as a tool, but reading through those tips, my complacency evaporated.

Anyway, I think this one chapter is worth the book‚Äôs price.
5. Deep and Profound.

Despite ‚Äúdumbing down‚Äù the language, The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry is still a very deep book. And from time to time, some sentence would hit me like a ton of bricks. A few reflections:

  It‚Äôs wise to regularly deny ourselves from getting what we want, whether through a practice as intense as fasting or as minor as picking the longest checkout line. That way, when somebody else denies us from getting what we want, we don‚Äôt respond with anger.‚Äù

Well, John is more of a saint than me. Too often, I do respond with anger. But he is right that asceticism builds barriers between the impulse and the automatic reactions. I‚Äôve never thought of my ascetic practices that way, but I agree 100% with the above passage.

  We achieve inner peace when our schedules are aligned with our values.‚Äù

Well said, indeed! We regret doing things or not doing them exactly because they are out of sync with our values.

I like cleaning a kitchen from time to time to express my love for my wife. But I cannot fully replace her in this task because then I would scramble to find time for writing. Putting bread on the table is as important as cleaning, and it is my task in our household.

When I regret that I binge-watched a TV series or YT channel, it‚Äôs because I didn‚Äôt align my actions with my values.

Now, I seriously think I should have a closer look at my schedule and determine what‚Äôs aligned with my values in it and what is not.

  Life is right under our noses, waiting to be enjoyed.‚Äù

Hurry literally robs me of my life. If I don‚Äôt take time to enjoy my life, but chase the next shiny object, how would I ever enjoy my life? Pausing the race is a necessary prerequisite for enjoyment.

SUMMARY
The Ruthless Elimination of Hurry is not perfect. It‚Äôs too often snarky and ironic. Yet, it‚Äôs profound and mmarydeep at the same time. Writing a book with all of those characteristics is an art I appreciate.

The ‚Äòyouth‚Äô language and lame jokes spoiled my reading experience a bit, but just a bit.

The Bible analysis? Superb. I‚Äôve been studying the Bible for decades, and still I learned something new.

The how-to of slowing down the modern life? Superb. Challenging even for a guy like me who uses the technology as a tool, not an entertainment.

Overall impression? Superb.

The story grabs  you immediately and takes you on a journey of discovery.  It's about the courageous women who ran an abortion clinic when abortion was illegal.  It's about women who had no where else to go to get away from abusive husbands.  It's about the courage it took for women to join together and help each other, without regard to their own safety.  In the current political climate, the rights we fought hard for and won when I was a young woman are now eroding away. This story has re-lit the fire in me to stand up again and fight and march again.  I will need a wheelchair to ""march"" now but I will join with my sisters to march again.  I can not recommend this book highly enough.  I believe it will become scholastic required reading in the future, when hopefully, young women will not know that women's reproductive freedom was ever restricted.

It should be on every mandatory reading list for students HS and onward and every male who‚Äôs job is in a position to make decisions regarding women and their bodies and their wellbeing and reproductive health need to have read and written their reviews on this incredibly powerful and misinformed subject and the oppression and abuse that has been allowed to continue and the neglect that‚Äôs been inflicted upon the females who bring them their life and are the nurturing and life givers and she is the one who is responsible to make the decisions if she is capable to bring a child into this world and overpopulated poorly structured institutional failure that has been blatantly ignored abused and taken their agency of their own lives by passing unintelligent fatally flawed and harmful laws and policies and punish even further the desperation they have shown by having to sought out an illegal or fatal consequence of their termination of this unintended consequence of males having selfish and oppressive policies and systemic racist policies against females the very MOTHERS who‚Äôve sacrificed her entire life each and every time she proceeds to bring a child and life into existence hers is dangerously in perils way. Because no male could ever and will never have to know what a pregnancy full term is like and worse the LABOR and inarguably the most painful process including dying is while also putting her own fate in the fate and mercy of their own lives because ask any educated unbiased physician and they will tell you what birth and pregnancy does to the body and it isn‚Äôt as simple and dismissive as ‚Äúwomen in other countries give birth standing up and go back to working in their fields‚Äù or ‚Äúwomen have been doing it since beginning of time it‚Äôs what they DO‚Äù that is the wrong rheutoric and incredibly stupid for lack of a better or more explicit definition of the mentality that has become repeated and actually thought of as facts and decided by men not ever will you hear a women dismiss the process of pregnancy or the labor and birth not to mention all the other ways in which her body is not hers for rest of her life once she is responsible for this child and it‚Äôs survival. It‚Äôs emotionally physically and mentally daunting and it‚Äôs one of the most rewarding and horrifically stressful decisions she will ever make and the lifetime of that bond and her lifetime of ensuring it‚Äôs survival and wellbeing is unspoken and unacknowledged in fact it‚Äôs expected of females to be birthing children even when they have made the choice right for them not to do so knowing it isn‚Äôt in their inclination to do. The pressure and the oppression as well as the blatant disregard for her safety security and welfare after the fact is left unchecked grossly negligent practices and laws against her safety security and welfare in the future is nonexistent. She has no monetary support but that of which she is expected to raise kids full time as well as work full time and be responsible for several other humans lives and her own while supporting them all in every aspect with absolutely no help or assistance or assurance she will be able to safely shelter feed and support her kids without the dependency of their ‚Äúfathers‚Äù and her retirement should be monetarily equipped to give her thanks for those years and for that life that without every single mum out there couldn‚Äôt have been possible or sustainable for the race if those men who ignore oppression and refuse to elevate the care and support and assistance of the females they have legally made responsible to give and protect that life the male has an orgasm in his contribution and somehow that is deemed fair enough to give him RIGHTS to his children and that women forever indebted financially towards him no matter how poorly he neglects or how violently he abuses her? It‚Äôs absolutely deplorable and this country and rest of the world still practicing in anarchic and antiquated practices radically need to change.
This and other themes like this need to be the repeated rhetoric the information recitated and reverence for this perspective and respect and gratitude for females especially women who have brought life into the world should be shown and given the praise and security in her and her children‚Äôs lives and futures that are ensured to be protected and sustained on the monetary and assistive institutions that are made available to all women to have access to and should be legally and financially entitled to.

Yes, the subject matter should be addressed beforehand for potential readers, although it is NOT just about abortion. It also addresses domestic violence and being trapped in a deadly situation.  Since I agree with women having a choice about their lives, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It should also be noted that events in the story took place around the mid 1940s, when women in the US truly had little to say to protect themselves. Also it is set in a small Kentucky town, which was not progressive in any way for years to come. In my opinion it celebrates the strength of a few women brave enough to help their sisters to have better lives, while knowing their own lives were in danger every day.

522,RUJNN03LI6JZJ,A fascinating look at the role of National Security Advisor and serving in the Trump White House,"H.R. McMaster's book is a fascinating account of what it takes to be the national security advisor and what it took to formulate national security strategy for former President Trump.

He provides:
- Insights into how national security policy is developed and implemented.
- A clear recollection of the major policy challenges faced in 2017 and early 2018.
- An understanding of the personalities that clashed within the White House.
- A up-close look into former President Trump's instincts and insecurities.

The latter is what many will focus on. But as McMaster notes, this book is meant to be an honest look into how the National Security Advisor serves the president. It is also a valuable resource to future public servants.

There is no question that McMaster is a dedicated defender of America and its ideals. His book will upset many of his detractors.

He takes us from the early period of his service where he is able to convince DJT to take some sound measures to address international challenges, to the final period where DJT has backed off on many of them, and  has begun his bromances with Putin & Kim Jung-un. The author states that DJT often makes good initial decisions (based on the author's advice), but criticizes him for not staying the course due to listening to too many voices of those who are not operating in DJT's best interests. The author never seems to ask ""why?"". Isn't it likely that when someone is as ignorant of past history and geography as DJT is, and recognizes that he is also not very smart, he doesn't know why his decision is right and he has no confidence in it, The next person he talks to can easily change it, and with DJT they often did. Also, the author seems to be oblivious to the impact that DJT's lack of any sense of morals or ethics, and his constant prevaricating, had on his efficacy as POTUS.  The author constantly disparages the Obama administration vis-a-vis DJT's, which seems biased and unrealistic. He has almost no commentary on events that took place subsequent to his leaving, as though his policies didn't affect them. At the end of the book he reports a phone call he received from DJT a few months after he left, saying what a good job he did. DJT has zero compassion, and is always looking for a benefit to himself. The author told DJT that he would be writing his memoirs. Really, did it not occur to him that POTUS was trying to influence the author's tone in writing this book, and was DJT successful? This book probably has enough details to please historians, but provides too much deference to the author's superior (the Commander-in-Chief), to please a more general audience.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XO1QKX3GDDRH,bunky222,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2024",True,,0062899503,,,

543,R2QIVTTP76XDBI,"Ages like a fine wine with a dark, full-bodied harbinger of doom, increasing with relevance as each year goes by.","What can be said about this book that has not already been said? Orwell‚Äôs despondent view of an evil utopia hits all the right notes. His vision into a near-possible future is stunning, depressing and all too understandable. A warning, a final prophesy written by a spirited visionary in the final stage of his life.

Many have read this book early in their youth, most likely as part of their educational upbringing. 1984 and Animal Farm are standard, pedantic texts battle ready for disaffected youth to sink their teeth into. This book, among the greats, seems boundless in the echoes and touchstones resounding within its tome. In revisiting the text many years later, one will find that Orwell‚Äôs words seem strangely even more relevant than they were at first blanch. Perhaps even more so than they were when original meted out and scratched into paper during the author‚Äôs self-imposed exile in the Scottish isle that was his final home so many years ago.

There are so many elements here that have such deep and broad depth that will keep this work of literature relevant for many more years. Orwell invented the terms ‚ÄúBig Brother‚Äù and ‚ÄúThought Crime‚Äù and dove unrepentantly into issues of privacy, personal freedom and individualism. All this before the revolution of the internet! He also fretted over the degradation of language (OMG!) and the breakdown and bastardization of society‚Äôs communal bonds, family bonds, bonds of friendship and the abolishment of simple love. His vision of a mechanized society (one that even turns books out by machines), is more than a decry by a luddite so much as it concerns the debasement or obliteration of the individual and sense of self.

Orwell‚Äôs main thrust seems to be right at the heart of man and the core inner lust for domination and power, simply for its own sake. That ever-present evolutionary tendency to thrive at all costs without purpose or direction, and the ability of that singular impetus to take over and distort all else toward its own end. He digs that up out of the blackest parts of the human heart and disgorges it upon the shoreline of society receding tide as if to say, ‚ÄúThis too is what you are. Do not kid yourself.‚Äù

For me, this book was rough. The tone was bleak. Throughout. Unflinchingly somber and hopeless. Yet, the story of the protagonist and his struggle amid this world turned upside down, is relatable and believable. Despite the obvious despair and immeasurable odds, we do feel for Winston Smith (the protagonist) and we do root for him. We follow him in his desperation to find something, some way to express himself and make a dent in the impenetrable wall that has become the totalitarian society which he is a part. We feel his constant fear and ever present distrust of everything‚Äîalmost. The little glimmers of possibilities, even when they are squashed, keep your interest and balance the grim-gray that pervades everything.

One thing that struck me was that the female character Julia, is an interesting addition. She has a good amount of gumption and serves more than just a goal or love interest. She is fleshed out pretty well and adds a lot of dimension to the story by sharing the protagonist‚Äôs goals, but also coming from a slightly different more realistic viewpoint.

Another thing I found interesting in reading this book in present time was how insular the story is. We are just as stuck as the protagonist. All news of the outside world and the society is filtered to the reader through the regime in power. We never really know who to trust or when something might be real or made up or mere speculation. Nothing ever really seems certain. The story never ever escapes this ‚Äì there is never an Oz-like ‚ÄúMan behind the Curtain‚Äù moment. Not really. We are told how some things work, and sometimes by sources that are deemed more reliable than others, but we don‚Äôt truly find out.

This tight view point, keeps up a claustrophobic feeling that forces the storyline to remain connected to the protagonist‚Äôs individual struggle. Even though Winston Smith is concerned with larger concepts and a revolutionary struggle on a society level‚Äìthe story remains individualistic. However, the tale is not a man‚Äôs struggle with himself, it is a man‚Äôs struggle to find himself among others; the interrelatedness of things and how important that is. The totalitarian regime in power has distorted this effect and is manifesting control by continually putting up road blocks and pseudo-constructed, societal norms to hamper true progress and growth.

Even still, the individual struggles to find their place in society. As the story goes on, I think it is clear that most of this doomed society continues to struggle with this. And the powers that be, must expend an immense amount of effort and expense to constantly suppress this. In the end, can that really work? Have a care. Big Brother is watching.

544,RFTHMEFL8JRMX,A book that expresses rebellion & individualism,"‚ÄúBooks like Orwell‚Äôs are powerful warnings, and it would be most unfortunate if the reader smugly interpreted ‚Äú1984‚Äù as another description of Stalinist barbarism, and if he does not see that it means us, too‚Äù -Erich Fromm. George Owell‚Äôs book 1984 speaks about the questionable actions the government takes in order to protect and watch over the people living in their dystopian society. The themes outline the dangers of a totalitarian government and waves of manipulation as they suppress any sort of possibilities of citizens questioning their power. Some of these themes can be compared to our present day life. I recommend ‚Äú1984‚Äù, because it is a controversial book that grabs the reader‚Äôs attention as it reflects on government manipulation and  social class issues.
 ‚ÄúThe Party‚Äù is described as an unknown higher power that has total influence over its citizens. It is clear that the Party has manipulated its citizens to think in a ‚Äúcertain way‚Äù. One way they manipulate the citizens is the rewritten text from the past. The mutability of history causes citizens to believe that some make believe figures and events actually existed when in reality, it was created in favor of the Party. This is described  when Orwell states ‚ÄúWho controls the past,‚Äô ran the Party slogan, ‚Äòcontrols the future: who controls the present controls the past.‚Äù Winston participated in this when he invented a figure named ‚ÄúComrade Ogilvy‚Äù. This idea is a parallel to real life because in different countries, certain events are rewritten to appear patriotic towards the country. Another example of government manipulation is the widespread propaganda. Citizens were forced to view advertisements of hate towards ‚ÄúThe Brotherhood‚Äù (anti-government) group and Goldstein (Brotherhood leader). Citizens also participated in a week long event called ‚ÄúHate Week‚Äù which was designed to ignite anger and hatred towards the ‚Äúenemy‚Äù. Telescreens were also posted everywhere in order to keep track of the citizens' lives. These ideas are controversial to today‚Äôs society. Many are weary of the government spying on our actions through webcams and cell phones.  During election season, propaganda of leaders can be seen to create hate similar to how the Party forces propaganda to its citizens. There are three slogans the Party lives by: ‚ÄúWar is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength‚Äù.  Citizens of Oceania live by these quotes believing it is the correct ideas because the Party constantly repeats it. The parallel for this is that there are certain ideas that some countries live by that overall can be dangerous towards its citizens. The idea of government manipulation in 1984 is an eye-opening experience to read and will make any reader question whether any of these practices are happening in their real life.
 Social class issues were presented with the story through a concept called ‚ÄúInner Party‚Äù and ‚ÄúOuter Party‚Äù. The ‚ÄúInner Party‚Äù is the high and elite class of citizens of Oceania and they have less privileges than the ‚ÄúOuter Party‚Äù. The ‚ÄúOuter Party‚Äù is described as the ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù of the story. Most are given government jobs however, they are the most threatening to the government because they are intelligent enough to start a revolution. There are also the ‚ÄúProles‚Äù that have poorer conditions than the ‚ÄúOuter Power‚Äù and makes up 85% of the population. The Party controls the ‚ÄúProles‚Äù by exposing them to vices such as alcohol and pornography; furthermore, they are considered and viewed as animals. This social class system can be seen in today‚Äôs society. For example, in the United States, the ‚ÄúInner Party‚Äù is compared to the ‚ÄúTop 1%‚Äù. The ‚ÄúOuter Party‚Äù makes up the middle working class. Though not as extreme as described in the book, the ‚ÄúProles‚Äù can compare to the rest of America‚Äôs population: low working wages and mostly involved in vices as well. In the book, Winston writes ‚ÄúIf there is any hope, it lies with the Proles‚Äù meaning that if there is any hope for change for the regime, it would start the majority of the population. This is an idea that is popular in American politics. Leaders tend to campaign towards the low working class population because they know there is more of ‚Äúthem‚Äù in the population to vote. This theme can bring attention to the reader and persuade them to understand how their society is composed and ‚Äúcontrolled by the government‚Äù.
 ‚Äú1984‚Äù was one of the first books to explore the ideas of change and ‚Äúfree thinking‚Äù. This caused many institutions to ban this book, which is ironic because censorship was one of the ways the Party manipulated its citizens. I would recommend this book to encourage conversations about individualism and power.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RFTHMEFL8JRMX,Erin Rafanan,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on December 10, 2020",True,72 people found this helpful,0451524934,,,

546,R3OLCZNO0PD9XC,One of the most important books ever written!!!,"This is an essential read. I‚Äôve known about this book for years but never thought to pick it up till now‚Ä¶ and, am not disappointed. Plot is intricate and perfectly constructed to create a dystopian world that seems plausible in every respect. Every young person needs to read this book‚Äîit is especially timely for what is going on in the world today. Social media has become a hotbed for the spread of propaganda and too many young people today have no idea that they are being played by powers beyond that have a deliberate interest in manipulating their own ideologies and activism. George Orwell‚Äôs 1984 was written as a response to communism and the types of totalitarian governments that rose up in Europe in the mid-20th century‚Äîbut history repeats itself which is why this book will forever be valuable. This book is a lesson on how propaganda works‚Äîand how not to be susceptible to it. The plot is also extremely fast paced and includes all kinds of relationship stuff to make it a compelling and fun read. What fascinates me the most is how Orwell‚Äôs premise on how language can manipulate thought and how false information can be used to make people believe things that are not true is interwoven into the story: if you are the kind of person who at times goes on social media and thinks you may be the only sane person left in a world where no one is sane, this book is for you.

547,R1SXP40O54LBJB,"9/11 false flag, Moon Landing hoax, JFK coup d'etat; Orwell offers us a path to consciousness.","&#34; ' How is the dictionary getting on?' Said Winston, raising his voice to overcome the noise.
'Slowly,' said Syme. &#34;I'm on the abjectives. It's fascinating.'
He had brightened up immediately at the mention of Newspeak ...
'The Eleventh Edition is the definitive edition,' he said. ' We're getting the language into its final shape -- the shape it's going to have when nobody speaks anything else. When we've finished with it, people like you will have to learn it all over again. You think, I dare say, that our chief job is inventing new words. But not a bit of it! We're destroying words -- scores of them, hundreds of them, every day. We're cutting the language down to the bone. The Eleventh Edition won't contain a singe word that will become obsolete before the year 2050 ...
'It's a beautiful thing, the destruction of words' ...
'Don't you see that the whole aim of Newspeak is to narrow the range of thought? In the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible, because there will be no words in which to express it.' &#34;
- George Orwell, '1984'

&#34;Logic, therefore, as the science thought, or the science of the process of pure reason, should be capable of being constructed a priori.&#34;
-Arthur Schopenhauer, The Art of Controversy
(&#34;a priori&#34; is defined as deduced from self-evident premises)

By revealing the concept of &#34;Newspeak&#34; in his great dystopian novel '1984', George Orwell, while dying of tuberculosis, cryptically attempted to expose to the world one of the great crimes of government against humanity; the systematic suppression/subversion of essential tools of reasoning; both in language and science. Central to this crime is the deliberate suppression of the science of formal logic. (Formal logic, invented by Aristotle in the fourth century B.C., is the science of evaluating arguments in order to determine if they are correctly reasoned. ) I will fully explain.

You see, the masses haven't been taught formal logic by State controlled public schools or media for many generations. (In his book ' The Underground History of American Education' John Taylor Gatto informs his readers that this deliberate dumbing down of the population through State controlled schools was adopted nationwide just after the completion of the U.S. Civil War.) Don't believe me? Just go out and ask some average U.S. adults how to determine if a deductive argument is both valid and sound; or the difference between a formal and an informal logical fallacy. (Both are very basic and essential knowledge of formal logic.) You'll find that not one in twenty have any idea. This is not an accident.

The terrible and murderous lies of our governments rely upon the masses being misinformed, ignorant, and intellectually crippled. And our State controlled schools and media have done this job very well, I'm sorry to say.

&#34;Ignorance is strength.&#34;-George Orwell, 1984

The list of criminal conspiracies, committed by the oligarchs who control our governments, are difficult for most people to psychologically accept. They include the subversion of free systems of government, fraud, illegal war, and genocide on an almost unimaginable scale. Here are a few for which the available evidence is simply overwhelming:

(1) Arab terrorists did not carry out the attacks of September 11, 2001.
(2) Man never walked on the moon.
(3) HIV does not, and never did cause AIDS, and our governments have always been aware of this fact.
(4) JFK was not murdered by a lone assassin.
(5) The Gulf of Tonkin Incident, which justified U.S. entry into the Vietnam War was a hoax.
(6) The homicidal cyanide gas chambers of the holocaust are a fraud, devised by the Allies to dehumanize the German enemy, and generate support for the people and state of Israel. The Germans never murdered anyone with cyanide gas.

There are many, many more bloody lies, as you will see, if only you will accept George Orwell' s invitation to finally become conscious.

&#34;If there was hope, it must lie in the proles, because only there, in those swarming disregarded masses, 85 per cent of the population of Oceania, could the force to destroy the Party ever be generated. The Party could not be overthrown from within... But the proles, if only somehow they could become conscious of their own strength, would have no need to conspire. They needed only to rise up and shake themselves like a horse shaking off flies. If they chose they could blow the Party to pieces tomorrow morning. Surely sooner or later it must occur to them to do it? And yet--!&#34;
-George Orwell, 1984

Here are few quote/definitions regarding formal logic that I hope you will find useful.

&#34;Ignorance is preferable to error; and he is less remote from truth who believes nothing, than he who believes what is wrong.&#34;
-Thomas Jefferson

&#34;We ought in fairness to fight our case with no help beyond the bare facts: nothing, therefore, should matter except the proof of those facts.&#34;
-Aristotle, Rhetoric

&#34;The truth or falsity of a statement depends on facts, not on any power on the part of the statement itself of admitting contrary qualities&#34;.
-Aristotle, Categories

&#34;We suppose ourselves to posses unqualified scientific knowledge of a thing, as opposed to knowing it in the accidental way in which the sophist knows, when we think that we know the cause on which the fact depends, as the cause of that fact and of no other, and further, that the fact could not be other than it is&#34;
-Aristotle, Posterior Analytics

 &#34;The province of Logic must be restricted to that portion of our knowledge which consists of inferences from truths previously known; whether those antecedent data be general propositions, or particular observations and perceptions. Logic is not the science of Belief, but the science of Proof, or Evidence. In so far as belief professes to be founded on proof, the office of Logic is to supply a test for ascertaining whether or not the belief is well grounded.&#34;
-John Stuart Mill, A System of Logic (1843)

&#34;Fallacious reasoning is just the opposite of what can be called cogent reasoning. We reason cogently when we reason (1) validly; (2) from premises well supported by evidence; and (3) using all relevant evidence we know of. The purpose of avoiding fallacious reasoning is, of course, to increase our chances of reasoning cogently.&#34;
-Howard Kahane, Logic and Contemporary Rhetoric, 1976, second edition

&#34;The fallacy of suppressed evidence is committed when an arguer ignores evidence that would tend to undermine the premises of an otherwise good argument, causing it to be unsound or uncogent. Suppressed evidence is a fallacy of presumption and is closely related to begging the question. As such, it's occurrence does not affect the relationship between premises and conclusion but rather the alleged truth of premises. The fallacy consists in passing off what are at best half-truths as if they were whole truths, thus making what is actually a defective argument appear to be good. The fallacy is especially common among arguers who have a vested interest in the situation ttho which the argument pertains.&#34;
-Patrick Hurley, A Concise Introduction to Logic (1985)

&#34;Aristotle devides all conclusions into logical and dialectical, in the manner described, and then into eristical. (3) Eristic is the method by which the form of the conclusion is correct, but the premises, the material from which it is drawn, are not true, but only appear to be true. Finally (4) sophistic is the method in which the form of the conclusion is false, although it seems correct. These three last properly belong to the art of Controversial Dialectic, as they have no objective truth in view, but only the appearance of it, and pay no regard to truth itself; that is to say, they aim at victory.&#34;
-Arthur Schopenhauer, The Art of Controversy

&#34;The hypothesis most likely to prove right must do the following: 1. Include all known facts; 2. Not over-emphasize any part of the evidence at the expense of the rest; 3. Observe the laws of probability as established by previous investigation; 4. Avoid logical contradictions; 5. Stay as simple as possible without ignoring any part of the evidence. Hypotheses which violate any one of these requirements are Forced Hypotheses.&#34;
-James Johnson, Logic and Rhetoric (1968)

  &#34;This is the argumentum ad verecundiam. It consists in making an appeal to authority rather than reason, and in using such an authority as may suit the degree of knowledge possessed by your opponent.
  Every man prefers belief to the exercise of judgment, says Seneca; and it is therefore an easy matter if you have an authority on your side which your opponent respects. The more limited his capacity and knowledge, the greater is the number of authorities who weigh with him. But if his capacity and knowledge are of a high order, there are very few; indeed, hardly any at all. He may, perhaps, admit the authority of professional men versed in science or an art or a handicraft of which he knows little or nothing; but even so he will regard it with suspicion. Contrarily, ordinary folk have a deep respect for professional men of every kind. They are unaware that a man who makes a profession of a thing loves it not for the thing itself, but for the money he makes by it; or that it is rare for a man who teaches to know his subject thoroughly; for if he studies it as he ought, he has in most cases no time left in which to teach it...
 There is no opinion, however absurd, which men will not readily embrace as soon as they can be brought to the conviction that it is generally adopted. Example effects their thought just as it affects their action. They are like sheep following the bell-wether just as he leads them. They will sooner die than think. It is very curious that the universality of an opinion should have so much weight with people, as their own experience might tell them that it's acceptance is an entirely thoughtless and merely imitative process. But it tells them nothing of the kind, because they possess no self-knowledge whatever...
  When we come to look into the matter, so-called universal opinion is the opinion of two or three persons; and we should be persuaded of this if we could see the way in which it really arises.
  We should find that it is two or three persons who, in the first instance, accepted it, or advanced and maintained it; and of whom people were so good as to believe that they had thoroughly tested it. Then a few other persons, persuaded beforehand that the first were men of the requisite capacity, also accepted the opinion. These, again, were trusted by many others, whose laziness suggested to them that it was better to believe at once, than to go through the troublesome task of testing the matter for themselves. Thus the number of these lazy and credulous adherents grew from day to day; for the opinion had no sooner obtained a fair measure of support than its further supporters attributed this to the fact that the opinion could only have obtained it by the cogency of its arguments. The remainder were then compelled to grant what was universally granted, so as not to pass for unruly persons who resisted opinions which everyone accepted, or pert fellows who thought themselves cleverer than any one else.
When opinion reaches this stage, adhesion becomes a duty; and henceforward the few who are capable of forming a judgment hold their peace. Those who venture to speak are such as are entirely incapable of forming any opinion or any judgment of their own, being merely the echo of others' opinions; and, nevertheless, they defend them with all the greater zeal and intolerance. For what they hate in people who think differently is not so much the different opinions which they profess, as the presumption of wanting to form their own judgment; a presumption of which they themselves are never guilty, as they are very well aware. In short, there are very few who can think, but every man wants to have an opinion; and what remains but to take it ready-made from others, instead of forming opinions for himself?
  Since this is what happens, where is the value of the opinion even of a hundred millions? It is no more established than an historical fact reported by a hundred chroniclers who can be proved to have plagiarised it from one another; the opinion in the end being traceable to a single individual.&#34;

548,R3G46K5YM5VSM8,One of the greatest novels of the 20th Century.,"It‚Äôs easy to dismiss Orwell‚Äôs masterpiece as a quaint and dated dystopia, a banal nightmare of the future cobbled together in 1948 out of the dingy present and the recent past: the bombed out London of the novel looks like nothing so much as that city under the blitz. The scarcities and rationing, the war frenzy, the propaganda and paranoia required no imagination to describe. They were right in front of him. Critics use Orwell‚Äôs merciless reportorial skill as a brief against his imagination. His grim fantasy is all too realistic. It fails both as fantasy and prophesy. The titular date has come and gone, they point out. The world is not divided into three super powers perpetually at war; no telescreens invade our privacy. No all-powerful totalitarian state controls our lives, which are in fact more free and prosperous than anyone could have imagined at the bleak and dreary end of the Second World War. Of the computer and the internet, plausibly the most significant new developments since that time, Orwell had not an inkling.
 But this superficial reading of the book, whereby we comfort ourselves with the fact that we drink Bombay Sapphire rather than Victory Gin, is tragically naive and misguided. In fact every basic concept, every philosophical and political development Orwell addressed in his book has come to pass almost exactly as described.
Orwell analyzed the way people driven by the need for power actually think. This is the most useful insight in his book, delivered by the Grand Inquisitor O‚ÄôBrien:
‚ÄúThe Party seeks power entirely for it‚Äôs own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury, or long life or happiness: only power, pure power ‚Ä¶ We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship to safeguard a revolution; one makes a revolution to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture ‚Ä¶ How does one man assert his power over another? ‚Ä¶ By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering how can you be sure he is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing. If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stamping on a human face ‚Äì forever.‚Äù
To this bleak vision the battered and terrified Winston Smith has one reply: ‚ÄúSomehow you will fail. Something will defeat you. Life will defeat you.‚Äù
Of course in the novel it is Winston Smith who is defeated and obliterated, after learning to love Big Brother. The story is unrelenting, a harsh tragedy in which the human spirit is crushed, and the future is too horrible to contemplate. The good guys lose. They are forced to betray their deepest beliefs and emotions, gutted of their souls and left to wander the streets like hollow eyed ghosts. Evil wins, over and over again, with a shriek of glee and blare of military music. The book ought to be profoundly depressing
 And yet it isn‚Äôt.  Just the opposite: it‚Äôs uplifting, thrilling. It‚Äôs a form of meta-text: the fact that you are reading the book at all, the fact that the book was written and published, confounds the darkness of its message. Winston Smith knows no one will ever read his journal ‚Ä¶ but people will be reading the novel that contains it for as long as books exist. The authors of the Newspeak dictionary exult in the destruction of language; the mandarins of the inner Party continuously dismantle all passion and morality and truth.  But the novel itself, with its vivid prose and ferocious probity creates an exhilaration, a giddy hope  in the reader that its characters can never share. A masterpiece. Read it.

551,R27QXFP20XUKG1,"The Ultimate Negative Utopia, Bar None","Comparisons between Orwell's NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR and Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD are so common in literary circles that they have become somewhat of a joke.  Especially when you consider that neither of these books was the first in the genre; while Huxley predated Orwell by seventeen years, somehow Zamyatin's WE, written a decade before BNW, often gets left out of the discussion (in fact it has been some time since I read WE, and I read two different translations, so I would need to tackle it again to review it properly).  And there are other novels in this genre that are worthy of consideration, such as Levin's THIS PERFECT DAY and Bradbury's FAHRENHEIT 451.  But at the end of the day, when it comes to the ultimate dystopia, it is Orwell's NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR that emerges as the absolute expression of the genre in all its nightmarish vividness.

London, 1984 (Or is it? Nothing is certain in this book).  We are introduced to Winston Smith, a clerical worker for the ruling body, an entity known only as ""the Party"" and represented by posters of a Stalin-like figure known only as ""Big Brother"" and the slogan ""Big Brother Is Watching You.""  Which is literally true:  everyone's apartment is equipped with a two-way television (""telescreen"") that sees and hears absolutely everything, from eating to sleep to sex, and which can be turned down but not off.

Winston's job sums up the Party pretty well:  it is his task to process changes to newspapers, history books, magazines, any form of literature so that the present will match up with the past.  In short, it is his function to completely obliterate history on a daily basis.  The world is divided into three primary ""provinces:""  Oceania (in which London is located and which oddly appears to include the United States), Eurasia, and Eastasia.  There is always a war going on between Oceania and one of the other two, but it is subject to change on a dime, and when it does, Winston and his team must scramble to change all records to make them state that Oceania has ALWAYS been at war with whichever one happens to be the enemy at the moment.

It is instructive that Winston performs his duties at a place called the Ministry of Truth, which is in fact dedicated to falsification of everything from history books to television shows.  There are two other Ministries:  The Ministry of Peace, which is concerned with war, and the Ministry of Love, which is concerned with horrors that I will not reveal here.

Speaking of love, this is where comparisons with Huxley actually have some merit.  Both novels have removed all meaning from the sex act.  But Huxley does it by making promiscuity the order of the day and making any feelings deeper than the basic tactile sexual sensations deviant, unnatural, and anti-social.  Orwell does it by making sex a crime except for the necessity of procreation and in his world pleasure for the woman is the unnatural thing.  Winston has a wife (who left him some time earlier), but the descriptions of their couplings are bone-chilling:  a dedicated Party member, his wife hated sex but insisted that they do it once a week to make a baby, calling it (God help us all) ""Our duty to the Party.""  Winston's relief at her departure is almost palpable even though we only hear about it as a past event.

Slogans abound in Orwell's world.  The three primary ones are WAR IS PEACE, FREEDOM IS SLAVERY, and IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH, all of which eerily recall the words that greeted the prisoners arriving at Auschwitz:  ARBECHT MACHT FREI (literally ""Work Makes One Free"" but more accurately ""Freedom Through Work"").

Orwell does not limit his inspirations to Nazi Germany, though:  I have already mentioned the resemblance between the mythical ""Big Brother"" and Josef Stalin; his characters address each other as ""comrade"" and there is mention made on more than one occasion of work camps that sound more like Siberia than WWII Germany.

Orwell was an unremitting pessimist.  The plot of his novel is so simple it is almost predictable:  Winston is an unhappy member of the Party, and unhappy people sooner or later do something rebellious.  Winston rebels, with a young woman named Julia, and there follows a brief period where things appear to be hopeful, but eventually the hammer falls, and the ending is almost preordained.

Which brings us to the one other valid comparison to Huxley; in BNW, London is a city so sterile you could probably eat off the floors.  NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR, on the other hand, is so grimy that you almost want to wash your hands after reading it.  The only other novel I can think of that presents the reader with such an unrelentingly gritty vision of the future is Harry Harrison's MAKE ROOM!  MAKE ROOM!, the inspiration for the film SOYLENT GREEN.

There are a lot of futuristic dystopias out there, and they tend to share various features:  the genre is a narrow one, rather like horror and science fiction, and some crossover is inevitable.  But NINETEEN EIGHTY-FOUR stands out, somehow, above all the others; it has a grim resonance that is not only rather depressing but one gets the feeling that his vision is not in the least bit impossible and that we would do well to take care that we do not end up in Oceania.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27QXFP20XUKG1,Scott E.

572,RZJC1DBWD4YM,A Masterclass in Psychological Suspense - Prepare to Be Utterly Floored,"Brace yourself, because ""The Housemaid"" is a novel that will keep you glued to the pages from start to finish, constantly questioning everything you think you know. Just when you believe you've unraveled the twisted narrative, author Freida McFadden pulls the rug out from under you, leaving you breathless and craving more. This book is a true masterclass in psychological suspense that demands to be devoured in a single, uninterrupted sitting.

From the opening chapters, McFadden weaves an intricate web of mystery and deceit, introducing readers to a cast of complex characters and a seemingly idyllic suburban setting that harbors dark secrets beneath its pristine veneer. The story's central figure, the enigmatic housemaid Millie, is a captivating presence, her motivations and allegiances constantly shifting, keeping you guessing about her true nature until the very end.

As the plot unfolds, the tension ratchets up with each turn of the page, as McFadden deftly plants seeds of doubt and suspicion, forcing you to question the reliability of every character's perspective. Just when you think you've pieced together the puzzle, she expertly upends your assumptions, leaving you reeling and eagerly devouring the next twist or revelation.

What truly sets ""The Housemaid"" apart, however, is its ability to not only shock and surprise but also to delve into the depths of human psychology and the complexities of familial relationships. McFadden's exploration of themes such as trust, loyalty, and the lengths to which people will go to protect their loved ones adds a compelling emotional layer to the narrative, making the characters and their plights resonate long after the final page.

From the meticulously crafted plot to the richly developed characters and the haunting atmospheric backdrop, every element of ""The Housemaid"" is a testament to McFadden's skill as a writer. She masterfully keeps you off-balance, constantly second-guessing your assumptions and reveling in the delicious uncertainty that permeates every chapter.

In the end, this book is an absolute must-read for fans of psychological thrillers and suspense novels. It's a true page-turner in every sense of the word, a book that will keep you captivated from start to finish, leaving you breathless and utterly floored by its brilliant execution.

573,R1RLHRWOD0H38V,Great Book,"I liked this book. It is probably one of the better thrillers/mysteries I've read recently, and I did finish it quite fast. The writing style is extremely readable, but don't expect imagery and beautiful language -- this book is very plot-based from start to finish. In the middle, some aspects got a bit repetitive but I guess we needed to have some understanding of Nina, Andrew, and Millie. The book itself also veers off into a bit of romance towards the middle, if you're into that sort of thing this would be a great read, but if not it may get a bit boring. The twists, however, are quite strong. We get a few clues, although I would say that in this book they're actually less subtle than the second one. Definitely didn't expect the ending. For anyone planning on going into this book, you need to know that it's a thriller first, everything else second. The character development is mediocre, especially with Millie (imho), which is why I don't think I could give it any more than 5 stars. Overall, solid, I understand the hype and it's worth the read.

**spoilers**
I didn't really understand all that was going on with Nina's daughter, Cecelia. The whole idea of her being allergic to peanut butter and overall being a brat didn't work that well plotwise, unless she was just meant to be an annoying character all around.

600,RI7Q2RIBIB8ZW,You are judging a book by its cover??,"To preface this - I know about Gravity Falls and have watched (and enjoyed) a handful of episodes a few years ago with my now teenager son. I haven't watched enough to know the premise, character names, demons etc. Only knew that it was about funny paranormal stuff. And that Mabel was my favorite.

With that being said... When my teenage son asked for a book I immediately obliged without doing any research. Just purchased to capitalize on the fact that my teenage son wants to read something.

As soon as it arrived I was curious because the book cover looked a bit creepy so I ran to the reviews. Lots of.... opinions lol

However, I chose to sit and read this book with my son vs complain about it at surface level. We ended up cracking up at most pages and very much enjoyed it. A lot of it is really silly teenager humor, outrageous situations and some pop culture references.

Yeah, there's mention of demons, monsters, alternate realities and spells.... but it's not training your child to be an occultist. Not by any means, so please relax. Theres a whole 3 pages dedicated to a 2 billion year old Time Baby who just learned what a cow sounds like. It's silly, not scary.

The creepiest page to me was one where you have to read it in a mirror because it's backwards. But only because I hate perceiving myself.

As far as the literary value - appropriate reading level for teenagers. Has some decent ""big words"" which always help add to their vocabulary. The pages are formatted in a way that keeps the reading interesting and fun, vs bricks of paragraphs. Great funny graphics that made me personally laugh out loud many times.

602,R3JXS5O91QG8XT,Tantalizingly Provocative Guide to Power,"Introduction:
Today‚Äôs world is full of individuals who will lie, cheat, and steal to take the clothes off your back. They will go to any length to manipulate you or others around you, twisting the truth and bending others to their every whim. Undoubtedly, ‚Äòyou‚Äô who is drawn to this book, have experienced the misfortune of being victimized by one of these individuals.

Perhaps you have thought to yourself...
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre always 2 steps ahead!‚Äù
‚ÄúSomehow, they made ‚Äòme‚Äô look like the bad guy!‚Äù
‚ÄúEventually they‚Äôre going to get fired for this!‚Äù

You always find yourself playing defense, you never know what they‚Äôre going to do next, and you simply cannot understand why another person would be so horrible.

Take your power back ‚Äì Read this book!

‚ÄúWhat is good? All that heightens the feeling of power in man‚Ä¶‚Äù - Nietzsche, Friedrich. The Antichrist. 1888.

Synopsis:
The 48 Laws of Power is a book comprised of tactics, concepts, and lessons which successfully created or maintained power. Supported with stories from history, both modern and ancient, from the most powerful people and empires which have ever existed, each chapter is crammed page to page with value. For 430 pages you will be inundated with information which is crucial for all of life‚Äôs situations where power plays a dynamic (work, social hierarchies, politics, etc.). Written with ‚Äúthe old aristocratic courts‚Äù as the backdrop and Machiavelli to set the scenery, this book contends with our darkest inner thoughts during our least favorite interactions with those who have more power than us.

Things I love:
Writing ‚Äì The writing is very casual so that it is available to the widest possible audience. It can be read easily, flowing almost as smoothly as regular conversation. You will not be left wondering what a word meant or stopping yourself to grab a dictionary.

Printing ‚Äì This book has some extremely creative printing, placing supporting stories, poems, proverbs and more in the margin and printing ‚Äúimages‚Äù using text at the end of each law for visualizing a concept. I have not seen anything similar in a formal book like this.

Information ‚Äì Clearly all 48 Laws took an extremely long time to compile and write. You simply cannot comb the annals of history for compelling stories, retelling them concisely, in a brief period of time. This book is a labor of love, and it shows in every chapter.

Originality ‚Äì This book comes off as very genuine and creative. Everything about it from the cover, the red text inside, the formatting, it‚Äôs all unique. You can tell a lot of thought put forth to conceptualize this work.

Who Should Listen Instead of Read:
Relevant to everyone, ‚ÄúThe 48 Laws of Power‚Äù is excellent, however I believe there are a few people who would not enjoy their time reading this book.
- If you do not enjoy reading or learning history, this book will be difficult for you. The main content of the text consists of historical examples. The book is of medium length at 430 pages, so if this sounds like you, consider switching to audio.
- As mentioned above the text is 430 pages, so if you simply do not have the time in your day to dedicate to reading, you will spend a long time on this book. Again, in this instance I recommend switching to audio for efficiency.

604,R2TZZ6TRWD82UK,"""Mastering the Game of Power: A Captivating Journey Through 'The 48 Laws of Power' by Robert Greene""","""The 48 Laws of Power"" by Robert Greene is a compelling and thought-provoking book that delves into the dynamics of power and influence in various aspects of life. Here's my review:

Robert Greene's ""The 48 Laws of Power"" is a fascinating exploration of the strategies, tactics, and principles that underlie the acquisition and maintenance of power. Drawing from historical examples, anecdotes, and timeless wisdom, Greene presents 48 laws that illuminate the intricate dynamics of power dynamics in relationships, politics, business, and personal interactions.

One of the strengths of the book is its rich and diverse range of historical and contemporary examples, which illustrate each law in action. Greene's storytelling prowess brings these laws to life, making them relatable and memorable for readers. Additionally, the concise and accessible writing style makes the book engaging and easy to digest, despite its dense subject matter.

Each law is accompanied by practical insights and advice on how to apply it in various contexts, whether in navigating office politics, negotiating deals, or managing interpersonal relationships. While some laws may seem Machiavellian or morally ambiguous, Greene emphasizes the importance of understanding power dynamics for both self-protection and achieving one's goals.

However, it's essential for readers to approach the book with critical thinking and discernment, as blindly adhering to the laws without considering ethical implications can lead to harmful outcomes. Greene himself acknowledges the potential for misuse of power and encourages readers to use the laws responsibly and ethically.

Overall, ""The 48 Laws of Power"" is a compelling and illuminating read that offers valuable insights into human behavior, social dynamics, and the nature of power. Whether you're a business leader, aspiring entrepreneur, or curious individual seeking to understand the world of power and influence, this book provides a wealth of knowledge and wisdom to ponder and apply in your own life.

I highly recommend ""The 48 Laws of Power"" to anyone interested in psychology, sociology, leadership, or personal development.

606,R3CRIGYGYX3UAZ,DANGER: read at your own risk,"there seems to be a lot of love and hate surrounding this book, so if you are curious but unsure, this review should help you decide whether or not to buy the book, and how it will impact you

First, to understand the 48 laws of power, you must know two key ideas
1. you CAN NOT escape the power game. thinking you can &#34;not participate&#34; is as foolish as thinking that you could somehow escape gravity or make the sun stand still.  Robert Greene explains why in the intro with some excellent examples
2. the 48 laws of power are neither good nor evil; they are just LAWS.  If someone pushed a man off a cliff would you blame gravity for for his demise? This is the mindset you must adopt in order to  learn a lot from this book.

Things I Liked
- NEW PARADIGM
after reading the 48 laws, you will never see the world the same way again. once you understand some of these laws you will see many underlying currents and motives you did not see before.
- INCREASES POWER
one of the main reasons to buy the book. you wil become exponentially more powerfull by knowing and understanding these laws
-CRYSTAL CLEAR
every law is clearly outlined with &#34;transgression&#34; of the law, &#34;observance&#34; of the law, keys to power, and a &#34;reversal&#34;
-GREAT STORIES
the 48 laws are packed with mindblowing and sometimes humorous stories of people in history practicing these laws. this is helpful as some of the concepts are quite abstract.

What I didn't like

-RISKY
an old proverb says &#34; A man who plays with snakes will eventually be bitten&#34;. If you begin to use the 48 Laws improperly, you could get yourself in some dangerous situations, lose friends, piss off a lot a people, and destroy relationships
- REQUIRES DISCERNMENT
if you you are looking for a highly concrete book that the says &#34;do xyz and you will accomplish vyx&#34; look elsewhere. the Laws require good judgement and and and prospecting nature to practice and apply
-NOT FOR EVERYONE
 If you are aghast at the idea of manipulation and deceit then read with caution.

OVERALL: If you want to have more power or a better understanding of why different situations turn out the the way they do, you should definitely read the 48 laws of power by Robert Greene. If you want to be naive, easily manipulated, weak, you should ignore this book and go watch some netfilx.

R. Greene couldn't have been more thorough with dating back to the times we had Kings and courtiers. And then relating it to this current day proving that these techniques still work wonders. This author has shown me that he is many roles in one. Not only an amazing author but a very smart and intuitive person that is very in tune with others' psychological makeup. If he truly instills these laws into his life, it shows an abundance of patience ,strength and persistence necessary to practice what he preaches. I can't imagine that he wouldn't since anyone that would know this knowledge and use it in a beneficial manner (not just to be out straight manipulative and hurtful would be a fool to not want to put it into play.

611,R13K2BJFWALA5J,Great list of laws but questionable research on examples,"The 48 laws of power -- the actual laws are quite well written with a caveat. I am not sure how well researched the examples are. Using the following as an illustration:
""On the eve of an important river battle, the great third-century Chinese strategist Chuko Liang found himself falsely accused of secretly working for the other side. As proof of his loyalty, his commander ordered him to produce 100,000 arrows for the army within three days, or be put to death.""
1. First of all, this did not actually happen but was a story from a famous book, ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"", rather, the author of this book was from the 14th century, and historians could point to the ""getting arrows from your opponent"" incident first happening in the 8-9th century which presumably the author used in his book.
2. ""Chuko Liang"" (actually the person is Zhuge Liang) was not accused of secretly working for the other side. There was no such accusation -- the person who wanted Zhuge Liang to get the 100,000 arrows simply said, ""we need a lot of arrows and you need to deliver"" because that person was jealous of Zhuge Liang's brilliant mind, and wanted to destroy Zhuge Liang's reputation should he fail.
3. The person who suggested Zhuge Liang to obtain 100,000 was NOT his commander, but a general from a competing warlord's military, called Zhou Yu. Zhuge Liang is loyal to a warlord, Liu Bei; Zhou Yu is loyal to a different warlord, Sun Quan. Liu Bei and Sun Quan worked together in this specific battle against a third warlord.
4. Zhou Yu also never threatened to put Zhuge Liang to death.

Anyways, the astonishingly inaccurate details of this story made me question the existence of other inaccuracies -- while these stories are for illustration purposes, you wonder whether some of the laws can actually work well in those specific fact patterns, should some of the details be wrong.

For the Roman/Greek stories used for illustration purposes, I have also spotted inaccuracies.

I suggest the author of this book invite real historians and proper editors to thoroughly research the examples he used and do a re-write -- that is good penmanship.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R13K2BJFWALA5J,"Thank you, Swarovski, for finally making the tennis bracelet fit a size small wrist!

The story is mostly about 2 women, one a college professor, the other a real estate agent, longing for their past youthful enthusiasm and unhappy with their current situations. An unexpected event may provide them with an opportunity to change.

The plot is full of absurd situations and equally absurd characters. It does not try to be realistic, just to be funny. For me it was not LOL funny, just a smiling funny. The type of humor is a little like that in Janet Evanovich books.

628,R3R9N2446MOPLX,A Classic of Literature,"You're familiar with the basic story and maybe you read it long ago. You know the book is a classic and you remember seeing the movie as a child. But have you ever sat down and just appreciated this novel for the wonderful story that it truly is? This is story about racism, culture and societal expectations. But, most of all, it is a story about integrity and doing the right thing.

The story is set in the South: the town of Maycomb, Alabama in the 1930's. A place where white people have roles and black people have rules. This is where the great Atticus Finch is raising his two children - Jeremy (Jem) and Jean Louise (Scout). Although he is a widow, he does have the help of a servant named Calpurnia who is a cherished part of the family. Atticus is a public defender and serves on the State Legislature. He is a highly-educated and thoughtful man dedicated to his town, his neighbors, his family - and justice. His motto: ""You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view - until you climb into his skin and walk around in it.""

The story, however, is not told from his perspective, but from that of his daughter, Scout who is around 5 or 6 when the story begins and about 10 or so in its closing scenes. Through her eyes, we get innocence mixed with a precociousness and the wry sense of humor she has inherited from her dad. He's a lawyer and he asks a lot of questions. Sometimes he asks them when he already knows the answer and so does Scout. Atticus is always straight-forward about answering her. Jem tries his best with her, but he is also very young at the time and trying to find his way of fitting in as well.

The first few pages introduce a cast of characters and are somewhat challenging to get into. Best to relax and just enjoy the ride - it will all come clear as the story unfolds. Remember you are being introduced by a small child. The action starts soon enough, as Atticus is assigned to defend a black man accused of raping a white woman. The scenes leading up to and within the courthouse during the trial are brilliant and evoke so much emotion as you ""climb into another's skin and walk around in it"". The writing is so vivid and the characters really come alive. Your heart wants one verdict even though your head knows it's going to be another. The town gets past the trial and life goes on; or does it? Unfortunately, not for everyone. The ending is incredible and will not leave you for a long time to come.

I read this book as part of a banned book project and I thoroughly enjoyed it! I fell in love with Atticus Finch and Scout and I hope to become a better person for it! I'm glad when young people review this book and are shocked by what the world offered in 1935.

629,R1BD0J0SX7N2U8,A Look Into Our Soul,"If ever there were a book I would consider voting for as the ‚ÄúGreat American Novel‚Äù, Harper Lee‚Äôs To Kill a Mockingbird is the one‚Ä¶the only one. It is hard for me to say that there is a one great anything. Times change, technology improves, and social views evolve. In short, we are never the same from one generation to the next and trying to pick anything that spans the gap and the differences as the greatest of all is difficult, if not a complete waste of time.

When it comes to literature, there are so many fine books and so many great writers that trying to narrow the selection to the ‚Äúone great one‚Äù interferes with valuable reading time‚Ä¶generally. But then there is To Kill A Mockingbird.

Harper Lee‚Äôs story takes place in the small southern Alabama town and county of Maycomb during the depression era 1930‚Äôs. She paints a picture of the community and the people populating it through the eyes of Scout (Jean Louise Finch) the daughter of a prominent local attorney, Atticus Finch. As the book opens, Scout is preparing to begin her first year in grade school.

She and her brother Jem and friend Dill pass the summer doing the things children did before the age of video games and twenty-four hour television. They played. They entertained themselves. They went on adventures. They told stories about the frightening, recluse who lives on the corner. They were children.

They did all of this under the watchful eyes of Calpurnia, the black woman who is housekeeper and surrogate mother to the family. Scout describes her as ‚Äúall angles and bone‚Ä¶with a hand as wide as a bed slat and twice as hard‚Ä¶‚Äù

In the Finch household, Cal is treated as an equal, a partner in the upbringing of the children and an indispensable member of the family. That is in the Finch household. Outside their small world, things are different in the community of Maycomb.

I find Calpurnia to be one of the most interesting of characters in the story. She is a strong and independent black woman who makes her way in the world dominated by whites. Scout is amazed on one occasion when visiting at Cal‚Äôs church that she spoke differently to other blacks, using their particular colloquialisms and dialect. It was very different from the way she spoke with Scout and Jem in the Finch home. Scout had no idea that Calpurnia lived this ‚Äúdouble life‚Äù relating differently to the two cultures in Maycomb.

In short, racial prejudice reigns, as was common in the time. Blacks, Negroes as polite members of the community called African Americans in that day, are second-class citizens with a place in the universe of Maycomb that is always inferior to the whites. Even the most white-trashy, ignorant, slovenly of whites holds a place in the community superior to any of the blacks.

As a southerner who grew up in the south in the 1950s, I remember the ‚ÄúJim Crowe‚Äù days. I went to schools that were not desegregated. I saw white only water fountains and restrooms. Black children were to be treated kindly, but we did not associate as a rule. They had their world. We had ours.

As Scout paints a picture of Maycomb through the experiences she shares with Jem and Dill, it begins as a sort of ‚ÄúMayberry-esque‚Äù, idyllic memoir of her childhood. But events open her eyes to the underlying darkness of their culture. Maycomb is not the perfect little world she thought.

She is guided by her father, Atticus, through the twisting cultural maze she inhabits. He teaches her not to judge others, but to get in their shoes and walk around a while to see how the world looks from their perspective. Most importantly, never kill a mockingbird because all they do is sing and bring happiness without harming anyone else. Atticus is the rock in Scout's world, giving her rope to explore and float about on the sea, but always there to anchor her safely.

Brother Jem (short for Jeremy) and friend Dill are her conscience and mentors in a way. Dill, rambunctious but sensitive, opens her eyes to things she had missed in their small community. Jem, sees and struggles with the contradictions around them...white people they have known all their lives as good people, doing things and saying things that they know to be wrong.

Through her innocence and confused effort to understand what is happening around her, we see that things are socially complicated. Whites harboring racial prejudice are not all evil as Scout describes their interactions. Instead, you get the feeling that they are ignorant, not seeing the contradictions in their lives, one instant treating a black member of the community in a courteous friendly manner, the next making sure they understand their place in the community‚Ä¶second class.

Some, however, are evil. The Ewells are the evilest of them all. Their conflict with Atticus and his defense of a black man, Tom Robinson, accused but innocent of a terrible crime leads to a chilling climax in the concluding chapters.

In the event that there is someone who has not read the book or seen the movie, I will not include any plot spoilers here. Just know that it is a gripping story with a conclusion that keeps you on the edge of your seat before Lee allows you to take a breath in the final chapter.

The prose is superb. The story is engaging and riveting. There are moments that will make you smile, others that will make you angry and some that might bring tears to your eyes.

Most of all, Harper Lee‚Äôs use of a little girl, Scout, to bring the narrative to life is masterful. It is not a children‚Äôs book, but through the eyes of a child, we see ourselves and the world around us. For me, that is why To Kill A Mockingbird is the great American novel. It spans the gap of generations, and through Scout‚Äôs eyes, looks into our soul.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1BD0J0SX7N2U8,Glenn,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2015",True,35 people found this helpful,0060935464,,,
630,R3TZXJ6QK4FRRJ,My Review,"Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is a literary gem that captures the essence of a sleepy Southern town, offering a profound exploration of human behavior and the moral crisis that shook its foundations. Published in 1960, this novel swiftly became an instant bestseller, receiving critical acclaim and earning the Pulitzer Prize in 1961. Its subsequent adaptation into an Academy Award-winning film solidified its place as a classic in both literature and cinema.

The narrative of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is an eloquent portrayal of the dichotomies within human nature - from innocence to experience, kindness to cruelty, love to hatred, humor to pathos. Set against the backdrop of a small Alabama town, the story encapsulates the complexities and struggles of the human condition.

Harper Lee's storytelling is at once compassionate, dramatic, and deeply moving. Through the perspective of Scout Finch, the young protagonist, the novel offers a poignant examination of societal injustices, racial prejudice, and the moral conflicts that challenge the town's moral fabric.

The timeless appeal of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' is evidenced by its widespread success, with over 18 million copies in print and translations into forty languages. Lee's ability to capture the essence of human relationships and societal dynamics makes this regional story universally relevant.

Originally regarded by its author as a simple love story, 'To Kill a Mockingbird' has evolved into a masterpiece of American literature. Its enduring relevance and impact lie in its ability to engage readers across generations, inviting contemplation on timeless themes such as justice, empathy, and the struggle between right and wrong.

The characters, particularly the iconic Atticus Finch, have left an indelible mark on the literary landscape. Atticus's unwavering moral compass and his dedication to justice remain a beacon of integrity and moral righteousness.

While the book tackles weighty themes, it does so with grace and subtlety, inviting readers to reflect on the nuances of life and the intricacies of human behavior.

'To Kill a Mockingbird' is a timeless classic that stands as a testament to the enduring power of storytelling. Its narrative remains as relevant today as it was upon its initial publication, continuing to prompt reflection and conversations on the complexities of human morality.

I rate 'To Kill a Mockingbird' with five stars for its masterful storytelling, poignant exploration of human nature, and its unwavering impact on literature and society. Harper Lee's work remains an essential read for those seeking a deeper understanding of the human experience.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TZXJ6QK4FRRJ,Howabout1337,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on October 30, 2023",True,18 people found this helpful,0060935464,,,

632,R4L2D7QK9RSNZ,Undisputed classic,"‚ÄòYou never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view... Until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it.‚Äô

Harper Lee‚Äôs To Kill A Mockingbird is an undisputed classic that few will avoid having read in their lifetime, and those few are to be pitied. As I habe presentation of the novel coming up this weekend, a discussion group that I am lucky enough to be allowed to lead as part of the The Big Read here in Holland, Michigan, I felt it necessary to revisit this timeless classic (and I figured I‚Äôd review it to help collect my thoughts on the subject). The experience was like returning to a childhood home and finding it warm and welcoming and undisturbed from the passage of time, like walking the streets of my old neighborhood and hearing the calls of friends as they rode out with their bikes to greet me, of knowing the mailman by name and knowing where all the best places for hide-and-seek were, the best trees to climb, and feeling safe and secure in a place that is forever a part of yourself. Though some of the mechanics of the novel seemed less astonishing than my first visit more than a decade ago, the power and glory was still there, and I found a renewed love and respect for characters like Atticus, whom I‚Äôve always kept close to heart when wrestling with my own position as a father. Harper Lee created a wonderful work that incorporated a wide range of potent themes, wrapping class systems, gender roles, Southern manners and taboos, and an important moral message of kindness, love and conviction all within a whimsical bildungsroman that no reader who has been graced by its pages will ever forget.

‚ÄòThe one thing that doesn't abide by majority rule is a person's conscience.‚Äô

Before dipping into the novel itself, I‚Äôd like to take a moment to speak about Atticus Finch, one of my favorite characters in all of Literature. Atticus is a pillar of morality, a man of honor, integrity, and most importantly, conviction. He is humble and honest, even admitting to his children that yes, indeed they are poor. In a novel about society, with its tumultuous mess of morals and class, Atticus is like an authorial deus ex machina, being Lee‚Äôs method of inserting moralizing and an example of what constitutes a ‚Äògood man‚Äô into the book through character and not authorial asides. I‚Äôve always idolized Atticus and tried to think ‚Äòwhat would Atticus do?‚Äô when it come to being a father and undertaking difficult moral conundrums (I even named my second cat Catticus Finch). Atticus takes the unpopular position of defending a black man in a rape case when assigned to him despite the town nearly ostracizing him. Atticus does his duty, and does it well, as a man of conviction that believes in doing what is right and honorable regardless of the consequences, living up to his statement that ‚ÄòReal courage is when you know you're licked before you begin, but you begin anyway and see it through no matter what‚Äô. In fact, Lee originally intended to name the novel Atticus before deciding it would stifle the broad perspective of Macomb by drawing too much attention to one character. Atticus remains steadfast throughout the novel, sure of himself and fully developed, whereas those around him undergo more a sense of change and development. This is a novel about personal growth and a broader understanding of those around you, and Atticus is the anchor to integrity and morality keeping his children centered in the violent storm of emotions and violence that befalls Macomb.

‚ÄòWhen a child asks you something, answer him, for goodness sake. But don't make a production of it. Children are children, but they can spot an evasion faster than adults, and evasion simply muddles 'em.‚Äô

There is a childlike innocence spun through a novel of such weight and seriousness, executed brilliantly by Lee‚Äôs choice of Scout as the narrator. We are forever seeing a larger world through the eyes of a young girl still trying to find her place in it while making sense of all the hustle and bustle around her, and this creates an incredible ironic effect where there are large events going on that the reader understands but are delivered nearly through defamiliarization because the narrator cannot fully grasp them¬π. The narration allows Lee to balance the coming-of-age hallmarks with the weightier themes, allowing the reader to maintain an innocence from the rape and racism while still able to make sense of the society functioning at large, and retreating from the darker themes into the fun of the children‚Äôs comings and goings. What is most impressive is how everything blends together, and the lessons learned in each aspect of their life are applied to all the other elements they come in contact with. The fates of Tom and Boo Radley are emotionally and morally linked in the readers mind, heart and soul.

All the standard bildungsroman motifs that make people love the genre are present in To Kill a Mockingbird, from schoolyard quarrels, to learning your place in society. We see Scout, Jem, and even Dill, gain a greater understanding of the world and their place in it, watch the children come to respect their father for more than just being a good father, see them make dares, terrorize the neighbors in good fun, and even stop a mob before it turns violent. With Scout, particularly, there is an element of gender identity at play that leads into a larger discussion about class and society. Children learn from those around them, and Scout spends much of the novel assessing those around her, perhaps subconsciously looking for a role model for herself. The ideas of what a good southern woman is and should be are imposed upon her throughout the town, such as Ms Dubose who criticizes her manner of dress, or Aunt Alexandra and her attempts to eradicate Scout‚Äôs tomboyish behavior, and she learns to dislike Miss Stephanie and her gossipy behavior. Miss Maudie, however, curbs gossip and insults, and puts on the face of a southern lady, but still gets down into the dirt in the garden and behaves in other, more boyish, ways that Scout identifies with. The gender identification becomes a cog in the gear of Southern tradition in manners and class. While the court case is unquestionably controversial due to the racial implications, it is also because it forces people to discuss rape and involves questioning the Word of a woman. It forces up a lot of taboo that the community is uncomfortable in being forced to deal with it, and many inevitably turn a squeamish blind eye when forced to confront the ugly truths at hand. Macomb is a society where everything and everyone has their place, a set identification, and they do not like it being disturbed. Most important to note is the correlation that the characters who are most inclined to uphold societal traditions through self-righteous brow-beatings often exhibit the most rampant racism throughout the novel.

‚ÄòMockingbirds don‚Äôt do one thing except make music for us to enjoy. They don‚Äôt eat up people‚Äôs gardens, don‚Äôt nest in corn cribs, they don‚Äôt do one thing but sing their hearts out for us. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a sin to kill a mockingbird.‚Äô

There are many ‚Äòmockingbird‚Äô characters in this novel, such as Tom and Boo, but the real mockingbird is, to me at least, the innocence that is lost. The town is forced to see each other for who they really are, to question their beliefs, to grow up with all the racism and bigotry going on around them. Atticus teaches Scout that we cannot know someone until ‚Äòyou consider things from his point of view‚Äô, and through the novel we see many misjudgements of character based on misunderstanding or characters refusing to see beyond their closed opinions, or even something as simple as Scout and Jem believing the rumors of Boo Radley as a bloodthirsty maniac. ‚ÄòPeople generally see what they look for, and hear what they listen for.‚Äô This applies to many obdurate aspects of society, such as Miss Maudie stating ‚Äòsometimes the Bible in hand of one man is worse than a whiskey bottle in the hand of-oh, your father,‚Äô emphasizing the ways that a closed mind is just as dangerous as a violent hand and that even religion can be misused. There is a message of love, of looking into the hearts of others and not just judging them, a message of compassion and open-mindedness working through To Kill a Mockingbird, and it is a message that we all must be reminded of from time to time.

There are a few issues that arose on a re-reading of the novel, having grown myself as a reader since I first encountered this lovely book. While the moral lessons are important and timeless, there is a sense of heavy-handedness to their delivery. Particularly at the end when Sheriff Tate points out the dangers of making a hero of Boo Radley.
taking the one man who‚Äôs done you and this town a great service an‚Äô draggin‚Äô him with his shy ways into the limelight‚Äîto me, that‚Äôs a sin. It‚Äôs a sin and I‚Äôm not about to have it on my head.
This statement is quickly followed by Scout mentioning to Atticus that ‚ÄòWell, it‚Äôd be sort of like shootin‚Äô a mockingbird, wouldn‚Äôt it?‚Äô. It seems a bit unnecessary to reiterate the point, especially when Tate‚Äôs double use of sin was enough to draw a parallel to the message earlier in the novel that it is a sin to kill a mockingbird. This, I admit, is overly nitpicky but brings up a conversation about teaching this novel in schools. This book is, ideally, read at a time of the readers own coming-of-age and the connections they are sure to draw with the characters reinforce the love for the novel. It is also a time in life when you are just beginning to understand the greater worlds of literature, and overtly pointing out themes is more necessary for readers when they haven‚Äôt yet learned how to look for them properly. It is books such as this that teach us about books, and usher us into a world of reading between the lines that we hadn‚Äôt known was there before. Another quiet complaint I have with the novel that, despite the themes of racism, Calpurnia seems to be a bit of an Uncle Tom character. However, who wouldn‚Äôt want to be in service for as great of a man as Atticus, so this too can be overlooked.

To Kill a Mockingbird is a novel surely deserving of it‚Äôs classic status. Though it is not without its flaws, there is a timeless message of love that permeates through the novel. It is also of great importance as a book that young readers can use as a ladder towards higher literature than they had been previously exposed to. Lee has such a fluid prose that makes for excellent storytelling, especially through the coming-of-age narrative of Scout, and has a knack for creating exquisite characters that have left their immortal mark in the halls of Literature as well as the hearts of her readers.
4.5/5

‚Äò...when they finally saw him, why he hadn‚Äôt done any of those things...Atticus, he was real nice.

Most people are, Scout, when you finally see them.‚Äô

¬πThis style is reminiscent of William Faulkner, such as the court scene in Barn Burning from the detached perspective of a child. In fact, much of this novel feels indebted to Faulkner and the works of Southern Gothic authors before her, and the Tom incident and case feels familiar to those familiar with Faulkner‚Äôs Dry September or Intruder in the Dust. The way the most self-righteous and self-professed 'holy' also tend to be the basest of character morals is reminiscent of Flannery O'Connor as well.

636,R1SG6ZV38I5YEU,It was good to have Scout‚Äôs childish perspective and focus on a ...,"Reflections on Harper Lee‚Äôs novels - Spoiler alert, if you have not read these books and do not want the plots spoiled, I will spoil them here.

Well, I chose to read Harper Lee‚Äôs works in chronological order. I think I made the right choice. It was good to have Scout‚Äôs childish perspective and focus on a certain life-defining episode of her youth as the background for Jean Louise‚Äôs coming of age story.
Harper Lee took a few pages of her first work and turned them into a compelling, fully fleshed out story of childhood innocence disturbed by subtle yet turbulent reality. The account of childhood in small town Alabama with the underlying racial and social tensions puts us there, in the middle of this placid surface, this languid recounting of summer play and childhood imaginations ruled by the somewhat abstract, quite benevolent and highly principled Atticus Finch.

The Maycomb of ‚ÄúTo Kill a Mockingbird‚Äù is a tightly controlled universe where everyone knows their place. We accept the dictums of the time. The blacks live where they live, the white trash are just that but they are not all evil, and the servants, as seen through the eyes of the child, are there to serve but also to police and mete out reprimands or sage advice as needed. There is the required crazy person that must be present in every Southern novel. And, somewhere, in the very vague background are the local politics which will intrude in the idyllic, drowsy pace of life.

Of course, the idealization of Maycomb, of its inhabitants, of the unimpeachable Atticus, rest on that childish platform. If we look at it from the perspective of ‚ÄúGo Set A Watchman‚Äù we can see that this view of Maycomb as a place of seeming harmony, with well working social structures - this view of Atticus as a paragon of virtue and integrity - could not survive the sober scrutiny of adulthood intact.

I can see why Mockingbird is such a beloved novel ‚Äì in simple terms it is about doing the right thing even if you know you can‚Äôt win or change the world. This is the lesson. Atticus defends the black man accused of rape, stands up to the lynch mob, and forces his children to take insults with dignity. Wow, daddy is Gregory Peck at his best.

And yet, very subtly, the image starts to blur. It is almost like you can see the palimpsest of Watchman in Mockingbird. Atticus Finch holds a seat in the Alabama State Legislature to which he is constantly reelected. Would he have the support of his constituents if he did not uphold the status quo? He is assigned the Robinson case, he did not ask for it. He goes along with his sister‚Äôs prohibition of the children going to a black church. He tolerates the racism of others. He jokes with Scout that if women served on juries, trials would never end. Ultimately, he goes along with not investigating a murder.

Fast-forward, or rewind, to the Watchman universe- Jean Louise (formerly known as Scout) has graduated from college, is living in New York and comes home for her yearly visit. What do we learn right away? Her father is suffering from rheumatoid arthritis and cannot pick her up because he can‚Äôt drive to the train station. He relies on her boyfriend, an up-and-coming lawyer who has become like a son to him for day to day work. He is somewhat henpecked, somewhat tolerant of his sister‚Äôs control of the household and we soon learn that she is there because he needs her to take care of him.

Then we have the town of Maycomb, where the tensions are no longer simmering, they are at the forefront of activity. The white folks are pissed off about desegregation, the black folks are openly showing their distrust, the Citizens Council is hosting the Klan, and the boyfriend is deemed trash by the social powers that be.

From the moment that Hank picks her up we understand that she is seeing her hometown with different eyes - with eyes that have been cleansed of childhood cobwebs. Still, she is in denial about the one constant in her life. She thinks Atticus is in better shape than he actually is. She very slowly starts to come to grips with his frailties as she observes how his rheumatoid arthritis keeps him from doing simple things like tying his shoe laces, and also makes him dependent on others for rides to work. This coming to terms with his physical limitations is well crafted. It leads perfectly into the moment when, sitting in the same courtroom gallery where, at the age of six, she watched Atticus defend a black man because it was the right thing to do, she now watches him join forces with the height of Maycomb‚Äôs racist establishment. The stage where he became her guiding light, her moral compass, is the stage where he falls from grace. As she watches him introduce the speaker from the Klan, shake his hand, and offer him a platform to share his views, the scaffolding that has held Atticus up for the past 20 years comes tumbling down.

Jean Louise‚Äôs reaction is extreme; all is lost and she no longer has her rock. Her hero plunges off the pedestal. Up until this point, the narrative is solid, if somewhat predictable. She confronts her father and falls apart. She wonders what, if anything, about her life is true. She sees Atticus as a racist and feels deceived. The confrontation is realistic. He is who he always was and he knows that she needs to come to terms with it. As Atticus, the perfect Southern gentleman, would, he is gracious and understanding while, at the same time, completely comfortable with his world view. The blacks are backwards children who should trust good white men like him to make the world a better place for them. He and his peers know what‚Äôs best. Jean Louise feels betrayed and goes on a rampage of blame. Can a visit to her childhood maid set things right? During this visit, where she is treated politely but given no trust or warmth, Jean Louise finally realizes that her childhood memories veer into the realm of fantasy.

The rest of the novel is a mad dash through denial, acceptance, self-awareness and absolution. Atticus emerges once again as the paragon of parenthood. He is proud that she has become her own person and not just a follower of Atticus. Jean Louise realizes that she is still part of the system she abhors and makes peace with her role in the drama of racial relations in Maycomb. In the end, she realizes the status quo is a bad thing but, what are you going to do?

This is the part of Watchman which would have benefitted from careful and thoughtful editing. It is too rushed. A scene where she visits her uncle for a session of gnashing of teeth and pointing of fingers reads like a something out of a cheap melodrama leading to the clich√©d ‚Äúslap this woman so she will cease her hysterics‚Äù moment. This is followed in quick succession by the scene in which Atticus is proud of his daughter for becoming her own person and she realizes he is still her hero.

I am saddened by two missed opportunities in these last few chapters.

This is a coming of age novel where the heroine must lose her childhood innocence, realize that her father is not perfect, separate herself from him and become her own person who must somehow reconcile her idealized parent with the real human being. In Mockingbird the ground is laid for this process to take center stage. The loving attention to Scout‚Äôs inner landscape is missing for Watchman‚Äôs Jean Louise. I personally feel that the process of seeing the feet of clay and learning how to love your imperfect parent, while setting different standards for becoming the best person you can, is an amazing and fulfilling process. It can lead to a rewarding and loving adult relationship with that very important person in your life. It paves the way for learning how to develop mature and satisfying relationships with your lover/spouse/mate. It creates a blueprint for building positive relationships with your children. I feel that Harper Lee could have written that if she had had some good guidance.

Another missed opportunity is the one to explore how a person who is working through their own racism can live in a racist society. Ursula K. Le Guin explains this beautifully in her review of Watchman. For me, these are the important questions - How do you love people who are racist? Where do you draw the line? Will you live in a state of constant confrontation or will you let some things go? Is this right or moral? Where are you willing to compromise your values? Can you fit in and still hold your principles? Are you ashamed of your loved ones? Can you be a teacher and a guide without alienating them? Can you serve a higher purpose while maintaining your affiliation? When do you call it quits?  How do you love the victims of racism? Can you be truly their ally without becoming their ‚Äúsavior‚Äù? Can you ever see them as they want to be seen or respected as they should be respected? Can they truly love you? Are we deluding ourselves when we think that our servants, nannies, maids, could love us while they left their children behind, while making the difficult choice required to put food in their mouths? Could they stop themselves from loving the innocent child who will eventually become their oppressor?

This exploration could have been the lesson of this novel. I wish the original editors had asked Harper Lee to write both novels, I wish the original editors had taken the time and effort to work Watchman to its potential. I wish we had seen Harper Lee‚Äôs tremendous talent truly applied to a novel that could have taught us so much. That said, I do not regret having Watchman in my literary universe. The ideas, the passions, the archetypes, haunt me. This novel offered me some space for reflection and introspection. I can truly recommend it.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SG6ZV38I5YEU,Marie Vivas St. Louis,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on August 12, 2015",True,17 people found this helpful,0060935464,,,
637,RZB925QOPZI9Y,Still a great read,"I‚Äôve read To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee probably three times now, once when I was a child, once in high school and now. I didn‚Äôt appreciate it and all it was meant to be the first two times but I appreciate much more now.

This is a coming of age story of two children, Scout and Jem in south Alabama in the 1930‚Äôs and their daily lives as seen through Scout‚Äôs eyes when their father puts his life as well as theirs at risk for defending a black man who was unjustly accused of a horrific crime against a white woman in the community.

Social inequality was a very prevalent theme in this story, it was evident that people like the Finches were near the top then you had the other townspeople  then farmers like the Cunninghams then the Ewells and lastly the blacks. Scout and Jem weren‚Äôt allowed to be friends with or invite certain people home by their aunt not their father.

The other most prevalent theme was racial prejudice. Tom is a black man wrongly accused and then convicted of a crime against a white woman. The lawyer, Atticus, who defended him, felt he was an innocent man regardless of color and wanted to teach his children to stand up for what was right.

This was a funny story at times with all that the children were up to but it was heart wrenching to think of all the hatred that people can have towards one another and then very sad to see when one loses hope.

638,R1IYMEADK2Q6WU,"Best book I've read this year, by far. Informative, deeply-researched, and just fun to read.","This book is great. Informative, deeply-researched, and fun to read. It‚Äôs the kind of book that has something interesting on every page. This is, by far, the best book I've read this year.

The book is about a group of people Silver calls Riverians, after a river analogy he uses to structure the book. These Riverians come from across the political spectrum and are prominent in a wide variety of career fields‚Äîon Wall Street, in Silicon Valley, playing professional poker, advising casinos in Vegas, running Effective Altruism charities, and building crypto businesses.

What they have in common is a mindset about risk‚Äîthey embrace it‚Äîand an analytical framework for thinking probabilistically about, well, everything. They live in the world of expected value, marginal utility, game theory, and abstract models. And, in Silver‚Äôs view, they are becoming increasingly powerful in society. As tech leaders. As thought leaders. And as political influencers.

In contrast to the Riverians are those with a risk mindset Silver calls The Village. Composed of a wide variety of people but with concentrations in government, academia, and the media, the Villagers are skeptical of markets, more likely to adopt partisan identities (especially center-left politics), more likely to focus on equality as a value and seek to constrain capitalism and meritocracy, and more like to view risk as something to mitigate.

Villagers see The River mindset as too much unbridled capitalism and too little moral concern for the public good. Riverians see The Village as conformist and paternalistic political ideologues whose risk-aversion and culture war obsession are stifling progress on everything from technology to anti-poverty efforts.

On the Edge is structured as a tour through the various worlds of the Riverians. The first half of the book is about gambling‚Äîthe quintessential downriver activity. There are chapters on poker, sports betting, and the casino industry itself‚Äîand the people who are increasingly dominating these worlds through ever-more-sophisticated analytical tools.

Those familiar with Silver‚Äôs short-form work will find his usual analytical skills on display here. But Perhaps the most surprising aspect of On The Edge is just how deeply personal it feels. If you read Silver‚Äôs wonderful first book, The Signal and The Noise, the writing style and the argument have an air of journalistic detachment. Not so with On the Edge, which often reads like a memoir. As it turns out, Silver is more cardplayer than election analyst, much more at home with the gamblers than the political pundits. He also breaks the 4th wall often; early on it‚Äôs somewhat jarring. There‚Äôs a Hunter S. Thompson gonzo quality to the story, Silver an omniscient narrator but also a participant-observer in an increasingly fantastical wonderland of poker games, casinos, and sportsbooks.

The second half of the book goes both upriver‚Äîto the more respectable world of Silicon Valley venture capitalist, prediction markets, and the philosophies of Effective Altruism and Rationalism‚Äîand further downriver, where unbridled risk and temptation await in the world of cryptocurrency and other gray-market endeavors.

The most surprising takeaway from On the Edge is how concerned Silver is about the direction of much of the world of The River. Those familiar with his recent public writing might think that the main villain of the book would be a Village-mindset risk-averse pseudo-expert type, maybe a partisan journalist or academic. Instead, the recurring danger of the book is the one built directly into the River. What if a bunch of hyper-rational successful risk-takers don‚Äôt sum to a collective meta-rationality? And what happens when the game isn‚Äôt poker or startup funding, but a global existential threat?

This is an absolutely sprawling book that covers an insane amount of ground in-depth. The kind of project you can‚Äôt really imagine an editor greenlighting. It clocks in at almost 500 pages, but the sheer amount of content across so many domains makes it feel like double that. There are explainers, analysis, profiles, and commentary galore. You are going to learn a ton.

Luckily, Silver‚Äôs breezy writing and engaging style make it an easy and fun read, not unlike his short-form writing online. Every chapter is substantively enjoyable, and each works as a stand-alone examination of a distinct topic. At many points, I literally couldn‚Äôt put it down. Often, the through-line of risk and the larger themes of politics and society are only lightly present, with the focus kept on the inherently interesting characters and worlds they inhabit. The reporting and analysis are top-notch.

On the Edge also unconsciously captures this cultural moment almost perfectly. The stated through-line of the book is risk and the Riverian mindset, but an unstated theme is just how much of society has been transformed into fertile grounds for the application of analytics, and how much analytics have taken over in so many domains.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IYMEADK2Q6WU,Matt Glassman,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/90ebedda-c6ee-49bc-8264-de104341d63f._CR83,0,333,333_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2024",True,43 people found this helpful,B0CR4FYC8R,,,

For me, a lot of this was ""preaching to the choir"" with good stories and that was enough.  The people who would learn the most probably won't read it because they are too close minded to do so.  That's too bad but somewhat proves his point about the differences between the Village and the River.

642,R395ECLOW2K62J,Strong Introduction to ‚ÄúThe River‚Äù and the Forces Shaping Our World Today,"I really enjoyed reading ‚ÄúOn the Edge‚Äù and recommend it highly to others, irrespective of their interests, as it provides context for ongoing cultural wars and societal development.

Silver does an outstanding job of providing a tour of the ‚ÄúRiver‚Äù (Silver‚Äôs word for a section of society that effectively views the world through expected value calculations) as he sets out to do at the outset of the book. But more importantly, I found him to be measured in his praise and criticisms of it, which allowed for a more thorough examination of its component parts.

For some, this will be an articulation of beliefs and information that they inherently know. Yet, for others, this will represent an eye-opening account of how some of our society‚Äôs ‚Äúdifferent thinkers‚Äù view and engage with the world.

Following this book, I‚Äôm interested in a deeper exploration of how the River interacts with the ‚ÄúVillage‚Äù (what Silver calls the ‚Äúideological‚Äù or ‚Äúidentitarian‚Äù section of society, often seen as left-leaning academics and ‚Äúcoastal elites‚Äù), as well as a breakdown of the Village into its component parts. Namely, I‚Äôd want to know whether the global rise of populism in the last 10-15 years might be more ‚ÄúVillage‚Äù-ish than one would think.

648,R2UO2II9L1MVUG,A Court of Mist and Fury: A Riveting Sequel That Exceeds Expectations,"Sarah J. Maas astounds once again with ""A Court of Mist and Fury,"" the spellbinding sequel to her acclaimed ""A Court of Thorns and Roses."" In this captivating installment, Maas plunges readers deeper into the lush and intricate world of Prythian, where danger lurks at every turn and alliances are tested in the crucible of war.

Following the events of the first book, Feyre Archeron grapples with the aftermath of her harrowing ordeal and struggles to find her place in the tumultuous faerie courts. As she navigates the treacherous politics and power struggles of her new reality, Feyre discovers strength and resilience she never knew she possessed.

One of the most compelling aspects of ""A Court of Mist and Fury"" is the evolution of its characters. Maas deftly explores themes of trauma, healing, and self-discovery, as Feyre undergoes a transformative journey that challenges her beliefs and forces her to confront her deepest fears.

The introduction of new characters adds depth and complexity to the story, while existing characters are further fleshed out, revealing hidden depths and motivations. The dynamics between characters are as nuanced as ever, with alliances shifting and betrayals lurking around every corner.

Maas's prose is as lush and evocative as ever, painting vivid imagery that transports readers to the breathtaking landscapes of Prythian. The action is fast-paced and electrifying, keeping readers on the edge of their seats until the very end.

Overall, ""A Court of Mist and Fury"" is a triumph of storytelling, weaving together romance, intrigue, and high-stakes drama in a mesmerizing tapestry that will leave readers clamoring for more. With its compelling characters, richly imagined world, and pulse-pounding plot, this book is a must-read for fans of fantasy and romance alike.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UO2II9L1MVUG,Dnick1345,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on April 7, 2024",True,9 people found this helpful,B01DYO4MVG,,,
649,R3W50YV6RDQEE9,Read This NOW!,"I seriously don't even know where to begin with this review because all I want to do is fangirl so hard over how much I ADORED this book! Seriously people...every single word, every single scene is so gorgeously written and breathtaking that I had to stop multiple times while I was reading just to admire and appreciate what I just read. This book was absolutely excellent on so many levels that no words can do it justice (but I'm going to try because this is a review after all haha). I don't think it's any secret that Sarah J. Maas is an amazeballs author, but in case you need a reminder, just read this book and you will see the supreme talent this woman has. She could write a phone book and I would read it because somehow even that would be an amazing read. I've only said this about 1 or 2 other authors, but it's completely true.

‚ÄúThere are different kinds of darkness,‚Äù Rhys said. I kept my eyes shut. ‚ÄúThere is the darkness that frightens, the darkness that soothes, the darkness that is restful.‚Äù I pictured each. ‚ÄúThere is the darkness of lovers, and the darkness of assassins. It becomes what the bearer wishes it to be, needs it to be. It is not wholly bad or good.‚Äù

This book made me feel so many different things at once, and literally it has it ALL! There are amazing twists, snarky banter, beautiful writing, and just plain badass, awesome characters that you want to be best friends with. After finishing this book all I want to do is be in the Night Court and be apart of Rhysand's inner circle. It's probably unhealthy how badly I want this to happen right now. But even more, SJM wrote scenes bursting with heart-pounding action, swoonworthy romance (which be warned, will leaving you squeeing), and female empowerment...GAH! I NEVER wanted to stop reading. But you know what I loved the most? Even though this story is a romance, it is also a story of self-discovery.

‚ÄúI was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal.
I was a survivor, and I was strong.
I would not be weak, or helpless again
I would not, could not be broken.‚Äù

Feyre goes through so much and is incredibly strong. She is extremely relatable because even though she loses herself for a bit, she finds that inner fire that she once had and it causes a spark to ignite within her. She becomes even more amazing than her character was previously, and finds herself on her own. Feyre is such an admirable and relatable character. I mean who among us hasn't felt lost at one point or the other in their life?? Feyre shows everyone that you have to look inside yourself and find your own inner strength to rise above and accept the past, and never let that thing that caused you to be lost define you. We need to embrace the pain and the anguish that came with the hand life has dealt, and choose to move forward in life...or we will remain lost. The character development for Feyre was seriously one of the best character development's I have ever read, and I think SJM deserves a HUGE round of applause for giving all readers this character. She becomes stronger and more determined than ever to accomplish what she has set out to do. All the while she remains the stubborn and sassy character we love.

‚ÄúI was not prey any longer, I decided as I eased up to that door.
And I was not a mouse.
I was a wolf.‚Äù

Rhysand...literally I have no words for my love. My heart (and ovaries) were literally bursting with every word he said. He broke my heart multiple times, and there was one scene in particular where I was gross sobbing when he was revealing things to Feyre. He still remains that mysterious Dark Lord, but we are able to understand and see so much more of him than ever before. Like Feyre, Rhys grew so much in this novel, and I loved watching how he became a little less broken due to Feyre's presence in his life. Feyre provides a nice balance to Rhys, and they're banter is like no other. We all know how shameless a flirt Rhys is, but boy does he step it up in this book...and I loved every single second of it. He had me laughing so hard countless times, and I can't even tell you how much I love him.

The world that SJM has created is simply phenomenal, and I seriously don't know how she came up with her ideas, but let's just thank whoever that she did. There is so much to this world that we didn't know, and I loved learning so many new things over the course of the book. We visit more courts and see different races. We see the political uneasiness that ultimately exists in this world, and how alliances can change at the drop of a hat. And then comes the ending...it is brutal and ripped my heart out, but it left me begging for more! For the entire conclusion I basically had my jaw permanently dropped and then my heart torn out because of the events that SJM wrote. But all I know is that I can't wait to see where she takes this series in the next book because there are truly endless possibilities!

‚ÄúTo the stars who listen‚Äîand the dreams that are answered.‚Äù

If you couldn't tell already, you need to read this book as soon as possible because this is the best book of 2016 so far!

Happy reading :)",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3W50YV6RDQEE9,Amazon Customer,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2016",True,25 people found this helpful,B01DYO4MVG,,,
650,R28D4JAU3EW0LN,Fifty Shades of Feyre and Rhys,"A Court of Mist and Fury is the sequel to A Court of Thorns and Roses. I don't even know how to function as I write this review. Sarah J Maas has literally just written her best book yet. And that's saying something because her Throne of Glass series books are phenomenal.

Feyre has completely transformed in this book. We last seen her made into a Fae, after Amarantha had killed her Under the Mountain in book one. All 7 High Lords from each court used a spark of their power to revive Feyre, and make her into a Fae. What they didn't know was that they would make her into something beyond their power. When they gave her their spark, they also gave her powers from each court. Throughout the book we see her train and practice her new found powers, and she definitely comes into her own.

Her relationship with Tamlin becomes very strenuous because like Feyre, he was broken in more ways than one Under the Mountain. We see him become a very dark and tortured soul, holding Feyre as a captive. He does not include her in the going-ons of the court, and he insists on locking her up and having her guarded at all costs. Most would see this as an act of love, someone who literal saw the person he loves die, while he was forced to watch idly. However, Feyre feels stifled. And while she's broken too, she can't forgive him for not fighting against Amarantha as she destroyed her. And who can blame her. When Rhys, High Lord of the Night Court even tried fighting to save her, and at the time he was perceived as the enemy in Feyre's eyes.

Rhysand--- I don't even know where to begin. Never in a million years would I have guessed that a love to rival all loves would blossom between Feyre and Rhys. Due to their bargain, Feyre was forced to go to the Night Court once a month. Whisked away by the fiercely dark and handsome Rhys, Tamlin was forced to see his Fianc√© taken by his enemy. At first, Feyre hates him, until she truly sees the driving force behind Rhys' actions. He is dark and powerful, but he is loyal to those he loves, and would do anything to protect them, which winds up including Feyre. I won't give too much away, but the love that builds between them was so intriguing to read. Sarah J Maas made a very interesting choice to write this book with an older audience in mind. There were lots of intense sex scenes with not so quite kid-friendly language.

At first, this threw me off because I know this is a Young Adult book. I didn't see how well it would mesh together. But as the book progressed, Sarah's risk totally blossomed into something magnificent. Feyre's and Rhys' relationship was primal, animalistic, and intense. It showed us what we become when we let our base desires completely take over. It was a thrill-seeking ride, that often left me feeling hot and bothered---if you know what I mean.

Besides the development of these two characters, we also got to meet some new characters, those from the Night Court. Mor, the beautiful and powerful third in command, and also Rhys' cousin. She instantly befriended Feyre, and they had plenty of much needed girl-bonding time. Cassian, one of two of Illyrian's top fighters. An enigmatic, hot-tempered, yet playful character that is protective of both Mor and Azriel. Azriel, the one of a kind Shadowsinger. He encases himself in shadows, and the shadows speak to him. Rhys uses him as his spymaster, because he's a master at stealth and getting information out of people.He's also the other Illyrian that's the strongest fighter, along with Cassian. Also, he's completely in love with Mor. Lastly, my personal favorite, Amren. She's said to be an ancient creature. A creature that slipped into this universe when the world was created. While it's said that there might be others like her, she's also one of a kind. Her power is ancient , and Rhys said that its contained within the body she's using. However he lets us know that if she was ever released, the world would be in huge trouble. Amren is also Rhys' second in command.

The world building was absolutely mind-blowing in this book. Maas' descriptions of the city of Velaris, the city that Rhys has protected from the outside world, was so utterly beautiful. The landscape was breath taking, and the fact that it hasn't been influenced by outside forces and was able to prosper in peace was so beautiful to read about. It was like a hidden Utopia. Rhys has taken the brunt of negative opinions towards his court and him, in order to keep Velaris safe and untainted. He would rather be viewed as a sadistic killer, who's shrouded in darkness and can turn your mind to mush, rather than let his hidden gem Velaris be tarnished.

The plot was easy to follow and allowed us readers to see some of the history of the world within the book. The King of Hybern is the main villain in this book. He is using a Cauldron, the object that is believed to be what created all life, and holds unimaginable power, so he can wage a war on any who oppose him. He also wants to bring down the ancient wall that prevents the Fae from entering the land where humans reside.

Only one object can counter and nullify the Cauldron, and it is the book of Breathings. However, it was torn in two and carded off to two places. One is in the Summer Court, and the other is in the land where the human's are, protected by the Mortal Queens. This happened as a peace treaty back in the last war that Mor was very much apart of. She helped create the treaty between the mortal queens of that time and the Fae. Amren as ancient as she is, knows of the book and is the only person that can read it's language. And ironically, Feyre is the only one who can actually use it because she was once a mortal, and now is a Fae.

Overall, Sarah J Maas has written her best book yet. A Court of Mist and Fury is deeply primitive in its showing of our base desires. Love, sex, and bonding are taken to new heights in Feyre's and Rhys' relationship, and readers will often find themselves completely turned on. Readers will also lose their breath as they dive into Maas' many beautiful descriptions of her world. And will become engrossed in the history of the world she's created, and watch transfixed, as each character navigates within it and progresses the plot until it's nail-biting climax. The ending will have you pulling out your hair.

652,R34Y0ZHWGUN48L,"The ending was stunning, as always, but I had character issues.","** Warning: This is NOT a spoiler-free review like I usually write. I won‚Äôt give away twists from the very end but I WILL be discussing things that happened throughout the beginning and middle of the book! **

I was pleasantly surprised when I read A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES last year because going into it, I knew it was a story with a strong fae presence. By this point in time in my reading career, I wasn‚Äôt new to fantasy but I was still a bit picky about what sort of fantasy I liked and fae did not fall into that category of selected themes‚Ä¶ But knowing how much I loved Sarah‚Äôs Throne of Glass series and the fae presence there, I dove into ACOTAR and loved it! It had a bit of a BREAKING DAWN ending so I wasn‚Äôt quite sure where the second book would go but naturally I had very, very high hopes for it since I hadn‚Äôt been let down by a Maas book yet!

I won‚Äôt sugar coat it ‚Äî it actually took me a really long time to get into the swing of this book. I was enjoying the plot but the beginning felt so incredibly dramatic and I just didn‚Äôt feel like things were moving forward. There was a lot of time spent on Feyre‚Äôs PTSD from her time Under the Mountain and I absolutely understand and don‚Äôt think that her traumatic experience should be just brushed over. I do felt like there was too much time dwelling on it though. ACOMAF isn‚Äôt a short book and I think some pages could have been saved and still gotten the point across throughout a few sections in the beginning. If the book were more character-based instead of plot-driven, it might have been more appropriate but the plot really seemed to suffer because of this and this isn‚Äôt the first time I felt this way in a Maas book either. I understand that these characters have gone through something that truly does change them but I felt like I was reading about totally different characters when I started ACOMAF. Feyre and Tamlin were just not themselves and I think had ACOTAR ended with a bit more of this shadow or if it had slowly creeped in throughout ACOMAF, it wouldn‚Äôt have been as much of a surprise. I just really felt like I was thrown into a totally new environment and it was really hard for me to adjust to, especially since I had read ACOTAR over a year before I got to start ACOMAF.

I continued to have issues with Feyre throughout the book. I don‚Äôt know why but she was just really bothering me. Instead of snarky, witty comebacks, I felt like everything with her was taken as an insult and she was constantly being defensive and kind of hated everyone. It was really hard to watch her interact with characters and I started to latch onto new (or new-to-the-spotlight) characters like Rhysand and his gang. It did make me extra thankful for Rhys coming onto the scene and shaking things up, though! The interactions between Feyre and Tamlin were just unbearable and painful to read. Then I ended up on the flip side where although I didn‚Äôt want Feyre and Tamlin to still be together, I also felt really weird that Tamlin was almost totally absent from this book. He was there in the beginning and I won‚Äôt speak of the ending but this book was straight up about Feyre and Rhysand and it almost felt like a waste that we spent all that time building up a romance between Feyre and Tamlin in ACOTAR to have it totally change. I absolutely love where it went but it‚Äôs confusing to understand why the Feyre/Tamlin romance was so important and developed in ACOTAR and why Rhysand wasn‚Äôt more of a main character throughout that courtship to really get his foot even more in the door.

I‚Äôve followed the romances in Sarah J. Maas‚Äô books quite well, I think, considering they‚Äôre not always simple and straightforward. I know some people who have issues with love triangles or already have their OTPs with the first love interest really have trouble moving with the characters as they fall out of love or move from one interest to realize that their true match is someone else and I feel like I‚Äôve followed along with that fairly easily. I can see where people feel like the romance in ACOMAF is a love triangle and I guess to a certain extent it is, but Feyre also does not have interest in both men at the same time. It is quite complicated though so if you‚Äôre sensitive about triangles, you almost definitely won‚Äôt like the romance.

I personally loved the development of Rhysand as a love interest, especially once Feyre really started to struggle with Tamlin. I found it telling that at the hardest points in their lives, Feyre and Tamlin drifted apart and just couldn‚Äôt find a way to even communicate instead of being able to rely on one another and get through a hard time together. That doesn‚Äôt always mean that you shouldn‚Äôt be with someone but in the case of story telling, it‚Äôs a pretty big sign that the main character isn‚Äôt where they should be. I‚Äôve heard this complaint from other Maas readers but this is the first of her books where I really felt like the romance started to take over the book. While I did love the new Rhysand/Feyre development, I felt like there was a lot of back and forth between them before anything major (finally) happened and that could have been cut down to some more meaningful interactions instead of repetitive, similar situations that happened more than a few times throughout the course of the story. Their romance actually is a very important part of the plot so it‚Äôs not like I wanted it to be downplayed but I just felt like so many points of the large general story were pushed aside to develop the romantic moments and it started to turn more romance story than epic fantasy ‚Äî and yes, there are some cheesy romance book-worthy moments. Let‚Äôs just say this is NOT A YOUNG ADULT BOOK, friends. There are some very explicit scenes so if you have teens or are directing/teaching teens who are reading this series, you may not want to put this book directly into their hands. (Not that I‚Äôm saying censor them but. Ya know. Read it first so you know what you‚Äôre giving them.)

The sections where the plot progressed were really quite delightful. Sarah J. Maas is still a master at layering stories and it‚Äôs so interesting to see how much of a previous book comes back in a different light in a subsequent book. There were so many moments that the reader is able to recognize from ACOMAF and see from a different character‚Äôs perspective or reassess it with more information and it makes the story that much deeper! Once things started to really take off around halfway through and a little thereafter, the book was simply addicting and I couldn‚Äôt wait to see where the entire plot of the series was going! Sarah really does have an amazing ability to craft an overall series arc and it‚Äôs so fun to watch that develop. The ending positively floored me and it was hard to remember why I had been so frustrated for a while throughout earlier sections of the book. So many things were revealed, actions taken, and trusts betrayed that I just really didn‚Äôt know what was coming. The twists and surprises were epic and once again, I was left in utter anticipation of the next book!",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34Y0ZHWGUN48L,Brittany,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/31oUbhmHl6L._CR0,0,250,250_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on June 29, 2016",True,40 people found this helpful,B01DYO4MVG,,,
653,R1Y36G7Q0JSY2K,Where A Court of Thorns and Roses was a love story about a girl risking all to save her ...,"A Court of Thorns and Roses was one of my top books of 2015 - possibly even my number one. I have been (not-so-patiently) waiting on A Court of Mist and Fury literally since book one ended and obviously preordered a copy as soon as I could! Upon receiving it in the mail, I quickly started reading but didn't want to read it too quickly. This is one of those books you also want to savor! Especially knowing that I'll have to wait an entire year for the final book in the series. Before I jump into this review, let me say that I do not think Sarah J. Maas can do no wrong. I read the first two books in her Throne of Glass series before giving up on that one. But THIS series... In this series she can do no wrong because every single word of this book was perfection.

This book picks up where the first left off, with Feyre, Tamlin, and Lucien back at the Spring Court working on getting the Court back to its former glory. With all that she has been through, Feyre has been left a shell of her former self. Unfortunately, everyone seems to be more worried about keeping up appearances than making sure their Cursebreaker has what she needs to heal and live with her actions. Where A Court of Thorns and Roses was a love story about a girl risking all to save her Love, A Court of Mist and Fury is a story about a girl learning to respect herself, finding out who she really is after a huge trauma, with a love story weaved in. Feyre's character growth in this novel was incredible. I said in my review of ACOTAR that she was an unlikable character who I came to really love. Now I can honestly say that Feyre is an amazing, strong female character and the kind of role model I wish teens could read more about (as opposed to the weak female characters who allow a man to define them).

As I'm sure you have probably gathered, in this book Rhysand gives Tamlin a run for his money. As the synopsis says, Rhys has not forgotten the bargain he made with Feyre under the mountain and he plans to make good on it. While I did like Tamlin in the first book, I have made it abundantly clear over the last year that I did not know enough about Rhys to choose a &#34;team&#34; and would have to wait until the next book was released to decide. I can now say I am firmly #TeamRhysand at this point and I don't see that changing. Rest assured, there is no love triangle in this book whatsoever, which is a huge relief considering that's what most YA fiction gravitates towards.

I actually loved almost every character in this book, whether I loved them because they were so perfectly wonderful or horrible. The villains are just as terrible as they should be (although Amarantha is going to be damn hard to beat) and the new characters that Feyre aligns herself with grew on me as the story progressed. Surprisingly, I came to like Nesta much more than Elain, which is the exact opposite of how I felt about them in A Court of Thorns and Roses.

One of my favorite things about A Court of Mist and Fury (and honestly, there are so many) was the world building. In book one, we only got to see the Spring Court, Under the Mountain, and the human realm. This time we I got to travel with Feyre all over Prythian and, obviously, my favorite was the Night Court, which was anything but what I expected! Sarah J. Maas' beautiful writing style contributes so much to the love I have for this gorgeous world. I think a lot of other authors would have a really hard time making me care as much as I care about every single location Feyre visits. I'll admit, I usually skim when I get to descriptions of cities and such, but here I took my time to take in every single word on the page.

And then there's the story. Oh, the incredible, beautiful, heart-wrenching story. I loved every single agonizing minute of it. As I've already said, this book is about Feyre discovering who she is after Under the Mountain and she is stronger than anyone realized. There are multiple conflicts for her to deal with - mentally, in her personal relationships, and with a potential war brewing. The journey this book takes over 600+ pages is brutal and extraordinary and heart breaking and I adored it. I was actually a little worried that over 600 pages would be too much, that the story would get bogged down or that it would lag, but it didn't. There wasn't non-stop action, but everything that happened was relevant and I couldn't name anything that served only as filler.

Something to definitely keep in mind is that this book has significantly more sexual content than the first, but I'm totally okay with that. As a 28 year old lover of YA, I was thrilled for the authenticity this little bit of extra explicitness brought to this story. I mean, when characters are talking about marriage and are fighting wars, it's not out of the question that they're probably going to be having more adult relationships. But I do think it's important to point out for those readers who perhaps don't want to read steamier scenes. (I'm sure you could easily skip past them.)

As you can probably tell, I loved this book. I don't have a single bad thing to say about it, which is unusual for me, even when I rate a book five stars. I loved Feyre, I loved Rhysand, and I loved their constant bantering back and forth. I loved that Feyre learned to respect herself. I loved the gorgeous writing and world building and storytelling.

654,RV7OL5JY4M1WG,Rhysand + You = Hurry up and read this book!,"This book was everything I had hoped it would, and SO MUCH more! I loved it as much as I love Rhysland. There, I said it. There's romance, sensuality, character growth, action, betrayal, friendships, family ties, and so much more. The character developments, the story telling, the world building, and the way Maas wrote this story is AWESOME! This book is the packaged deal. Okay, I'll admit it, Rhysand is the packaged deal in this book.

I knew there was much more to Rhysand than we got to know in A Court of Thorns and Roses. Boy is there a lot more to him! I loved the way I got to know him in this book. Maas held things back from readers, allowing us to get to know Rhysand as Feyre got to know him. Part of that is what made it easier to fall in love with his character. The more I got to know him, the easier it was for me to really see him for who he was, and in turn made it easy to see the differences between him and Tamlin. Rhysland is that character you want on your side. He's loyal to those close to him, doesn't apologize for who he really is, doesn't hold back when it comes to loving a certain someone, and unlike some characters, he sees Feyre for all that she really is, and allows her to be who she is, and all that she's becoming.

Despite the fact he can make anyone do anything he wants, Rhysland gives Feyre choices, and allows her to make them. He wants her to be who she wants to be. Rhysand a character that readers will get to see all sides of, and fall in love with in the process. I love the way he treats Feyre, and his court. He's very powerful, someone to fear, yet for all the darkness that resides within him, I came to understand how the darkness he has calms and brings peace to Feyre. He is that person who isn't only compassionate and loyal when it comes to his court, he's someone who knows how to treat to a woman. He treats Feyre with so much love, respect and understanding. *sigh* Just wait until you see how he treats her... you won't be able to resist falling for him either. I've completely fallen in love with his character.

Feyre by all means is an equal to Rhys. Not only did I love their banter, electric chemistry, and those hot scenes between them ( I swear the pages ignited in this book more than a few times), I loved how she fell for Rhysand. The more I got to know him, the more I understood how she slowly started to fall for him. It was natural and made sense. Most importantly, I loved that she realized she is worth so much more than she's ever thought. I loved that she grew into a strong, fierce character/women who not only learned to love herself, but love someone who truly loved her, and didn't want to keep her in a cage. I loved that she learned to fight, and embrace her powers, both literally and figuratively. She grew so much, and I loved that she became a force to reckon with. What I admired the most about Feyre's character development in this book, is that she learned to love herself. She learned to embrace who she is, and all that she is. I respected her even more for that.

The romance and character chemistry in this book was on fire! The banter, and flirting between Rhysand and Feyre was, well that's just say these two know how to push each other's buttons, and get under each other's skin in all the right ways. Together, Feyre and Rhysland are something amazing. Aside from all the physical aspects, and passion these two share, I love that they chase away the darkness that threatens to consume the other. They both have experienced horrific things that they are still dealing with. They are each other's hope, and light. They're there for each other and help pull each other out of the darkness, or sometimes are there to hold the other as they endure the nightmares.

One of the things I liked about theme of love in this book, is the way Feyre came to realize what it truly meant to be loved and be in love, vs what she thought love was. I appreciated the fact that Maas doesn't just tell her readers this, she shows us through character actions. We see it through Feyre's realization of what Rhysand's been telling her, and how he treats her vs how Tamlin treats her. Tamlin's fall from grace is that he didn't respect Feyre enough to allow her to be herself. He didn't treat her like an equal, but instead wanted keep her locked up and in his possession. I may have got the 'why' in that, but I didn't agree with it at all. The contrast between how Rhysand and Tamlin both treated Feyre was painfully obvious through out the book.

Maas has a way with creating in-depth characters I really come to care about. She effortlessly brings them to life, as well as their stories, and vividly detailed worlds. I loved getting to go deeper into the Fey world, being introduced to more characters, and seeing the different parts of their world. I loved getting to know the Night Court. Maas has always created characters that really add depth to the story, and the Night Court was no different. I loved meeting and getting to know Rhys's inner circle. These characters weren't only friends, they are family, and it really showed in their story. Along with the Night Court, which has become my favorite court, I loved seeing more of the other characters, and learning about their histories, and ties together with their courts.

 I felt every range of emotion possible while reading this book. I laughed, I cried, I cheered, I swooned, got swept off my feet, was happy, angry (at a certain someone), and I completely fell in love with all that this book offered me. I officially have a book hang over. Sarah J. Maas what have you done to me?! The turn of events, the character developments, and the over all story are that good! I feel bad for the next book I read after this one, because I already had to re-read this book once, because it was so good. I don't even know what else I can say, other than, that is one heck of an awesome sequel! Now the torture will be waiting a whole another for the next book!

656,R1FTCHSSQ7EZ15,‚ÄúTo the stars who listen‚Äîand the dreams that are answered.‚Äù,"‚ÄúHello, Feyre darling,‚Äù he purred.

I forgot how utterly in love with A Court of Mist and Fury I am. A stunning story paired with the loveliest slow burn and a charming enemies to friends to lovers progression.

‚ÄúYou are my salvation, Feyre.‚Äù

Rhysand. He is, just, everything. Honestly a top tier book boyfriend. An alluring bad-boy paired with typical arrogance and a clever mind. His outward elegance and beauty are obvious but his internal beauty is what truly makes Rhys stand out. His selflessness towards his court and Feyre, the carefully crafted mask he shows everyone else, and the intensity that he cares and loves. Rhysand isn't perfect, not even close, but he really stole the show in this story.

‚ÄúYou think I don‚Äôt know how stories get written‚Äîhow this story will be written?‚Äù Rhys put his hands on his chest, his face more open, more anguished than I‚Äôd seen it. ‚ÄúI am the dark lord, who stole away the bride of spring. I am a demon, and a nightmare, and I will meet a bad end. He is the golden prince‚Äîthe hero who will get to keep you as his reward for not dying of stupidity and arrogance.‚Äù

Feyre spends most of her time in the Night Court, embarking on missions and adjusting to her new immortal life. I was so proud of Feyre and getting herself out the other end. This book is heavy on dealing with the aftermath of trauma from the events under the mountain and my heart really ached for her during the first half of this book. She grew an incredible amount and it was like coming back up for air watching Feyre, with the help of those who truly care for her, become stronger, more determined, and a dreamer.

‚ÄúWhen you spend so long trapped in darkness, you find that the darkness begins to stare back.‚Äù

There were so many scenes between these two that will live forever permanently in my mind.
‚ú∞ Feyre throwing her shoe at Rhys the first time he brought her to the Night Court üë†
‚ú∞ Their snow fight in the human realm ‚ùÑÔ∏è
‚ú∞ The Court of Nightmares throne scene üî•
‚ú∞ Their sparring match where he cocooned her with his wings ü¶á
‚ú∞ Their flirty note exchanges üñäÔ∏è
‚ú∞ THE PAINT SCENE üé®

‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking it would be very easy to love you. And easier to call you my friend.‚Äù

We were introduced to many new faces in aCoMaF and the most enjoyable were the Inner Circle with a special shout out to the High Lord from the Summer Court. But honestly, the IC are actual squad/family goals. Morrigan, Mor, is as loyal as she is fierce. Amren, I don't know who you really are but your arrogance and sass call to my heart. Cassian, the jokester who can bring a smile to anyone's face. Last but never least, Azriel, you mysterious and slightly stalker ways are like an invisible string to my deepest desires. I cannot express how critical it is in a fantasy series to have complex and dimensional secondary characters that you feel drawn to.

‚ÄúFor him, I had done this-for him I'd gladly wrecked myself and my immortal soul. And now I had an eternity to live with it.‚Äù

Finally, I want to discuss the big bad wolf in the room...Tamlin. I understand why he is so hated but I don't hate Tamlin. To be candid, even in the my first read through of this series, I was never really drawn to Tamlin or sold on his and Feyre being endgame. Something just felt off. This book really explored and demonstrated why they aren't good together. But that doesn't mean Tamlin is the villain he is portrayed through the lenses of Feyre and Rhysand. Tamlin also left that mountain with trauma and fear . It is this fear that drove most of Tamlin's action, in particular how he treated Feyre. His fear led him to overcompensate in how he protected Feyre, his need for control after having none, and his ignorance in the trauma that both he and Feyre were drowning in. None of this excuses his behavior but it helps us understand his actions. I think Tamlin has some really hard lessons to learn but if I know SJM, I like to pretend I do , I think Tamlin isn't too far gone that he can't redeem himself.

‚ÄúThat I will bow before no one and nothing but my crown.‚Äù

I am going to wrap this up and just say that after reading this series more than a few times, each time feels like a new addition to the experience and I find myself like one of those tiktok's of the bookish girls trying to dive into the physical book because I would love for nothing more than to actually be part of this world.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1FTCHSSQ7EZ15,Christina Marsh,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/943ac757-d5eb-4c7d-b07c-02d18f373325._CR0,26.0,281,281_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on March 12, 2024",True,4 people found this helpful,B01DYO4MVG,,,
657,R2GA7HVHLNKVEX,Felt rushed a bit,"*A Court of Mist and Fury* is a whirlwind of emotions that left me feeling both captivated and conflicted. While I was eager to see how Feyre‚Äôs story would unfold after the gripping events of the first book, I found myself frustrated by the pacing and some character choices. The first half dragged a bit, with too much focus on Feyre's internal struggles and not enough action to keep me fully engaged.

However, once the story picked up, it became a rollercoaster of twists and turns that had me on the edge of my seat! The dynamic between Feyre and Rhysand is electric, and their banter adds a fun layer to the narrative. Yet, I couldn't help but feel that some character developments felt rushed or inconsistent, especially with Tamlin's drastic shift in personality.

658,R1J2FIQL5KK68P,One of the best books to date!,"This has to go in my top 3 best books I‚Äôve read in a long time. I am not an avid reader, and am very selective. If a book doesn‚Äôt hold my interest I put it down and never pick it up again.
This book covers a MOST important and ignored by modern Christian topic: daily obedience to Jesus and the way He wants you to live. He has changed symantics which really puts a better frame of reference on the subject; it is apprenticeship as a synonym for discipleship. The book is filled with quotes that are to the point and timely. I love the emphasis on historical Christians and their writings without it feeling like a dry history lesson.
Overall the book kept my attention to the end. I found it thought provoking and I found my self putting it down to ruminate for a few days until I was ready for the next nugget. It also is extremely helpful, with practical things you can do, giving suggestions. I felt like I was gleaning from centuries of Christian thinkers, philosophers, apologists, without have to actually read them!!! I was challenged and inspired to be a better apprentice of Jesus.

668,R2B3BYHQ18XLIR,Lord of the Flies Review,"William Goldberg‚Äôs novel Lord of Flies tells the story of a group of British boys who are involved in a plane crash and find themselves deserted on a stranded island during World War II.  The boys rejoice in their new-found freedom since no adults survived the crash; however, they soon realize that chaos is never a good thing. Without order or civility, the true colors of the boys begin to show, and they realize that social order is crucial to their survival.
 Needing a sense of structure, the boys elect one of the boys, Ralph, as the chief of the group.  Ralph then assigns roles and duties to each of the other boys to survive until they can be rescued.  This seems like a good solution to their problem until rumors begin that a monster is residing on the island with the boys.  The boys decide to give a sacrifice to the monster in the form of a bloody boar‚Äôs head, which in time decays becoming ‚ÄúLord of the Flies.‚Äù  This unknown monster ‚Äúfear‚Äù ultimately lives inside each of the boys causing it to consume every moment of the boys‚Äô days and nights turning the boys against one another.  Their make-shift society quickly begins to unravel creating a conflict between the need for order and the savage nature of human beings.
 The novel delves deep into the four main characters showing how chaos can truly change a person and make one do things that he never imagined he could do.  The first character is Ralph, who is elected chief of the group.  Ralph is determined to maintain order within the group.  When the boys first arrive on the island, Ralph blows a conch shell like a make-shift horn signaling all the lost boys from the island to descend upon the group.  The second character is Piggy, who is smart and insightful.  Piggy becomes the most mature of the group; however, he is soon mocked by the other boys due to his physique.  Another character Jack is the hunter of the group and delights in hunting for wild pigs on the island.  Jack slowly develops a following of other boys who want to hunt, and this leads to a power struggle between Ralph‚Äôs followers and Jack‚Äôs group.  The last of the boys is Simon, the quiet type who likes to venture into the jungle to find solitude away from the others.  However, Simon‚Äôs solitude becomes his downfall when he starts to become crazy leading to the other boys killing Simon thinking he is the monster of their dreams.
 The climax of the novel begins after Piggy is killed, and Ralph, Jack, and one of the island‚Äôs lost boys named Roger set fire to the entire island.  Knowing he is the next to be killed by the group of savages, Ralph runs away and straight into the arms of a British naval officer signaling the end of the haunting journey for the remaining boys.  When the boys realize that they have been rescued, they burst into tears realizing what the evil that they have become.
 Human nature, the struggle between good and evil, and the ultimate darkness of man are central themes throughout the story detailing how even good people can be savage if it means survival.  The haunting story is a scary reminder that human depravity makes people do things unimaginable.  The struggle between savagery and civilization is something our own society has dealt with since the beginning of time.  The novel is a classic story that bleeds over into our world today and details how fear can be used as a weapon when needed to achieve a desired outcome.

Forster, biographical and critical notes by E.L. Epstein, and illustrations from Ben Gibson.

-----Lord of the flies/William Golding--1st Perigee hardcover ed., 50th anniversary ed., p. cm. ""A Perigee book.""
ISBN:  978-0-399-52920-7

OVERVIEW:  Author William Golding's debut novel, ""Lord of the Flies,"" was first published in 1954.  It follows R.M. Ballantyne's ""The Coral Island"" and further delves into the fundamentals of human nature by depicting the `what-would-happen?' of a group of young boys who have become stranded on an island--one previously untainted by man.  One of the central themes of the novel concerns two opposing ideas about society, i.e.:  democracy versus autocracy.  Other phenomena explored exist as struggles over morality, rational thought, and individuality, contrasted by immorality, emotional thought, and group-think, respectively.  When I was young and first read this book, I was embarrassed to say it was among my top five favorite novels.  I thought that admitting how captivated I was by ""Lord of the Flies"" would make me sound sadistic; I didn't have a good explanation for what I liked about it.  As an adult, I've come to realize that what I appreciated so highly was this novel's impeccable use of allegories and seemingly innocuous symbolism.  Even today, this is a book that, in my opinion, tells a highly valuable story--not only for young adults, but old adults as well.

NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENTS:  Following its premiere printing, ""Lord of the Flies"" managed to sell a meager 3,000 copies.  Almost a decade later, the novel saw a resurrection and quickly gained notoriety in schools and on best-seller lists.

SUMMARY:  Amid a worldwide nuclear war, a British evacuation aircraft crashes into the Pacific Ocean; the only survivors are a group of like-aged school and choir boys between the ages (presumably) of six and twelve.  On the deserted and unspoiled island, two of the children, Ralph and Piggy, come upon a conch shell which, when blown, permits Ralph to gather the remainder of the marooned party to one central location.  When the strayed survivors see that it is Ralph who summoned them all together, they naturally cling to this occurrence as the first action which remotely resembles stability and, thus, leads to the group's naming of Ralph as their chief.  Ralph's only opposition comes from the choir group which prefers Jack Merridew as chief.  All of the boys, from both the school and choir groups, note the conch as the tool which has bestowed upon Ralph his rank; the conch quickly becomes a symbol of power for he who possesses it.

In his first order of business, Ralph declares two primary objectives:  (1.)  have fun, and  (2.)  alert passing ships to the boys' position by smoke signal.  In order to spread some of the responsibility, Ralph creates a `cabinet' of sorts; in this analogy:  Jack, who leads the choir group in search of food, is the secretary of war; Simon, who is responsible for overseeing the shelter provisions (and who takes to caring for the younger boys, aka. ""littleuns"") is the secretary of homeland security; and Piggy--and overweight, glasses-wearing, and continuously mocked outcast--becomes Ralph's confidant and right-hand-man.

Without any rules or repercussions for failing to keep order, the tribe deteriorates; most of the boys prefer to spend their time not on constructive measures, but rather on developing a new island religion which revolves around an imaginary beast.  Perhaps subconsciously, Jack seizes the widespread fear of the beast as an opportunity to gain followers; he makes a vow to slay the beast responsible for tormenting the islanders and, thus, free his people of their woes.  Ralph, who is more concerned with necessities for survival, loses ground to Jack, the usurper.  Because the ""society"" members in charge of maintaining the smoke signal have given into the blood-lust promised by the beast hunt, the entire island misses the chance to be rescued by a passing vessel.

Despite the recent deterioration of the chain-of-command (and Ralph's constant deflection of personal insecurities onto Piggy), Piggy convinces Ralph that he must retain leadership for the good of the tribe.  In the middle of the night, Sam and Eric--a set of twins now tasked to feed the smoke signal--mistake the body of a downed fighter pilot for the beast, leading them to abandon their post in order to recoup with the others.  The new confirmation of the beast's existence causes a complete dissolution of Ralph's position as chief; Jack forms his own tribe and celebrates by sacrificing a boar and leaving the head as offering to the beast.

In the wake of the turmoil, Simon wanders off by himself and comes across the boar-head-offering.  The decomposing head is now swarmed with flies.  [It is not entirely clear, but likely that Simon experiences a seizure while looking upon the ""Lord of the Flies.""]  He hallucinates that the fly-covered head is alive, smiling, and speaking to him; it tells him that the ""beast"" is nothing more than a manifestation of the evil inside them all.  Simon goes on to investigate the downed parachutist mistaken by Sam and Eric for the beast; even though Simon knows his discovery of the truth about the beast will mean trouble for him, he hurries back to the feast to alert them all of their foolishness and, hopefully, shed proper light on the situation.

Dark and in the middle of ritual feast and dance, the savagery of Jack's tribe becomes evident as the boys willingly mistake Simon for the beast and kill him.  For Ralph, Piggy, Sam, and Eric, the realization that they have murdered a friend--one who wanted only to show them ""the way""--brings them to their senses; they sever ties with Jack's tribe.  Since Piggy's glasses are the only means the boys have of sparking fire, Jack feels that their absence from his camp on Castle Rock (a mountainous area of the island) poses a threat to his command; under cover of darkness, Jack and his followers steal the spectacles.

Piggy, perhaps the only `adult-like' character, believes what Jack really wants is the conch because, to Piggy, a tool which provides means of gathering everyone together is far more important that one which only serves to burn.  Angered by Jack's immaturity, Ralph, Piggy (carrying the conch), Sam, and Eric journey to Castle Rock to retrieve Piggy's glasses.  Not willing to be challenged, Jack orders Sam and Eric to be taken hostage and tortured.  Roger, Jack's henchman, thrives in the society which allows him to act unbounded; he kills Piggy by smashing him with a boulder, destroying the conch--the last symbol of civility--in the process.  Ralph barely escapes the slaughter, but is soon hunted by Jack and his tribe.  In an attempt to `smoke him out,' Jack and his followers set fire to the island.  As Ralph begins to consider his eminent death, readers can't help but be reminded of an earlier point in the book when Simon calmly, and almost prophetically, spoke to Ralph ""You'll get back to where you came from.... I just think you'll get back all right (p.154).""

The once pure island has now become an inferno; the billows of smoke have managed to signal a passing naval vessel just in the nick of time, as Jack's tribe is hot on Ralph's tail.  Ralph--tired, frightened, beaten, and hopeless--encounters the naval officer who has come to his rescue.  At the sight of the adult's presence, Ralph is finally relieved of his `responsibility to humanity;' Jack and his tribe are paralyzed as if they had been playing characters in some other-worldly video game, with the officer representing `Game Over.'  A sense of shame hits each of the boys when the officer suggests that, being British, the boys should have known how to conduct a proper society... ""Ralph looked at him dumbly.  For a moment he had a fleeting picture of the strange glamour that had once invested the beaches.  But the island was scorched up like dead wood--Simon was dead.... Ralph wept for the end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart, and the fall through the air of the true, wise friend called Piggy (p.286).""",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYJFQBYD8RQTA,JWolf,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/51Qu8rRVGnL._CR0,0,495,495_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on October 28, 2013",True,32 people found this helpful,0399501487,,,
670,R1K5XHBKU1BM0R,"Great Book, (Spoilers! I wrote a whole review).","SPOILERS! Lord of the Flies is a fairly interesting and fast-paced book. It sets a great example of how easy it is for a sophisticated society to become a collection of savage animals and leaves the reader with a lot to think about.
 First, the characters Ralph, Jack, Piggy, and Simon are introduced and become some of the most important symbols in the book. The characters are all unique and have different effects on each other throughout the plot. Ralph can be counted as the protagonist in this book and is a fair-haired chef representing civility. Jack is a power-hungry antagonist who symbolizes anarchy. Piggy is fat, has asthma, and acts as a scapegoat, but is smarter than anyone else; he symbolizes intelligence. Simon is a boy who volunteers to the point that it gets him killed, he is a symbol of human goodness. These characters become great contributors to the plot and theme.
 Speaking of the plot and theme, William Golding did an excellent job of reminding people how easily human nature can put society in danger of collapsing. It begins with the male middle school group stranded on an island with no adult supervision, it‚Äôs a thing to celebrate at first, but the group under Ralph‚Äôs attempts to raise a functioning society becomes more defiant of logic. Made-up creatures from nightmares and increasing arguments led to a downfall in the productivity and unity of the group. They then stop listening to Ralph entirely because they are deprived of fun feelings under Ralph‚Äôs logical perspective of island survival. Jack believes that they should have fun hunting pigs and chanting in circles until the day they die, with no hope of rescue in sight. The kids, being the middle school group they are, answer to Jack, except for the smart Piggy and twins Sam and Eric, who are captured or killed even by the other tribe. Simon was one of the few who did his best work under Ralph, even to where his work beat him down. Simon is killed around this time by the group, as they thought he was the fake beast they feared, even when he worked for the good of the group until he died. Ralph is left to survive with the savage group hunting him for the rest of the book until the island is set on fire, catching the attention of a ship that rescues them. When they meet the officer who descended to see what was going on, he asks if they are playing at war, and they agree, even with the mentioned two deaths from this savagery. It becomes clear that the members of a functioning society are ignorant of how easily life becomes a fight for survival when all else is lost.
 A good theme for the book goes something like the following sentence. Society‚Äôs flaws come from the flaws of human nature. This book shows that the human‚Äôs nature is to have fun, be lazy, and do what it wants. Society only functions when people mature. Maturing means doing stuff that you don‚Äôt want, helping others, and being aware of your mistakes. The middle schoolers in Golding‚Äôs book are not mature enough, except for Simon, Ralph, Piggy, and the twins Sam and Eric. They do their part in society but are crushed by the overbearing weight of the savages who let human nature control their every move. These savages blamed others for their mistakes, which led to increasing arguments and aggression towards others. These savages let laziness get the best of their civility, and the group suffered because of it. Other examples clearly show this message as well. In the grand scheme of things, this book is extremely cool and I would recommend it to anyone who wants more than a bad summary of it from me, and anyone who hasn‚Äôt read it at all. Just don‚Äôt tell them all the spoilers.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1K5XHBKU1BM0R,Beth williamson,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2023",True,3 people found this helpful,0399501487,,,
671,R2VY8GCL5L3FDQ,Lord of the Flies is an excellent book! (It should not be banned from schools.),"(Preface: This review is part of an extra-credit school assignment about whether classic books, such as LoTF, should be banned or not and why, so if the following seems a little different from an average Amazon product review, that's why.) :)

Lord of the Flies: Why It Should Not Be Banned

Reading William Golding‚Äôs famous novel Lord of the Flies recently was a fabulous experience.  Its chronicles of friendship, betrayal, and the battle between civilization/‚Äùgoodness‚Äù and man‚Äôs inner evil were both thrilling and intriguing. I read the book for a school assignment, and I must say that I was sorry that I had not read it earlier. It‚Äôs fascinating, and a great read for anyone above the age of 10 (there are a few gruesome scenes and images that may scare younger readers). Still, the violence is far from too graphic for middle-school students ‚Äì for them the pros of reading the book outweigh the cons. Lord of the Flies is an extremely well-written tale with intriguing plots and ideas. Young teenagers should read the book because it teaches about human nature, and because censoring literature that teaches morals in an intense way is not censoring‚Äôs purpose.
William Golding‚Äôs novel Lord of the Flies is one of the best books on human nature ever written. In the story, British schoolboys crash on an island in the middle of the ocean. They try to create a sort of makeshift society, but due to the lack of parental supervision, it breaks down and results in anarchy ‚Äì several of the boys die due to the chaos that ensues. By reading the story, children will learn about how the human psyche works ‚Äì and how dependent we are on society. Lord of the Flies is an incredible book that contains many important things ‚Äì some of these being civilization vs. savagery, individualism vs. community, the nature of evil, man vs. nature, dehumanization of relationship, the loss of innocence, and the negative outcomes of war. (What an incredible list ‚Äì would anyone deprive a middle-schooler of knowledge on these profound topics simply because of one scene that is a little graphic?) Lord of the Flies is a novel of profound messages, themes, and morals, and censoring is not worth missing out on learning from the book.
A second reason why Lord of the Flies should not be banned is that doing so would defy the purpose of censoring books. When a board or organization bans a book, they are doing so logically because the book that they are banning has little or no literary value. Of course, Golding‚Äôs novel is far from that ‚Äì as mentioned, it‚Äôs a work of literary genius with countless themes and lessons. Why ban a book and deprive students of such learning because of one scene? Teachers can allow students to skip the graphic parts, as many have done in my school. Besides, even if students choose to read even the scarier scenes, they are reading about human nature ‚Äì they‚Äôre not watching a horror movie with pointless, excessive violence that has no meaning or point for its existence. Lord of the Flies may have gruesome parts, but those parts are educational and only help shine Golding‚Äôs messages brighter.
In conclusion, The Lord of the Flies should be taught in school, because of its incredible literary and moral value, and because censoring it would defeat the purpose of censoring books in the first place.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VY8GCL5L3FDQ,Amazon Customer,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on February 3, 2014",True,2 people found this helpful,0399501487,,,
672,R1Y1OLMMKKZLDD,Classic!,"Lord of the Flies is one of those books everyone should read no matter what kind of books you like.  The story will stick with you for a long time and there is a timeless message hidden within the pages.  Even though I never read this in high school, this is defiantly a high school level book.  The reading is quick and easy once you get into it, just the plot might slow you down.  Everyone should read though if you want to understand great usage of motifs, foreshadowing, allusions to mythology, and get certain references from several books, movies, and television shows.

The main reason I started this book now was one I never read it before and two I have read all the Hunger Games.  Yes, Hunger Games is like Battle Royale, but they are both extremely close to Lord of the Flies as well.  Another reason I read this was that I heard Fables refers to it in the Animal Farm story arch, not just the pigs head on a stick, but the fact only one person can hear the ‚ÄúLord of the Flies‚Äù talk to them.  So, I went all Fables Fangirl at that part of the book.  I must say I also was constantly thinking about the Simpsons‚Äô episode were the kids are stranded on a disserted island.

Overall, I really liked the book.  It was somewhat predictable at times, but I think that was mainly due to the fact the book has been referenced so many times.  Not to give anything away but there is a lot of talk about Piggy‚Äôs glasses and how if he ever lost them.  At times, the dialogue was a little difficult to follow, but I just had to figure out who was talking when.  This is more of a personal issue, but authors need to stop stereotyping twins so much.  We are not the same person and makes it hard for me to follow books when they make them Samneric all the time.

I think my favorite character in the book was Piggy.  Right away, you just get a sense of feeling for him and you just want him to stand up for himself.  Ralph you get the feeling he is a complete jerk and you know he is going to be the main villain of the story.  I mean he calls Piggy by his nickname, when Piggy tell him not to call him that.  Although, Piggy was stupid for even trusting Ralph in the first place, as most innocent kids when they meet bad friends.  Clearly, Piggy just wanted a friend.

This is the type of book I could go on and on with in my review, but I‚Äôm not going to or I know I give away spoilers to those who are living under a rock and never even heard about this book.  As I previously said before, this is a book everyone should rad no matter what types of books you like to read.  I very much recommend it to those who read Battle Royale and Hunger Games though.  This is a great book too for a horror aspect of bullying and the flaws a government with too much authority.

673,R3B73UQEFY66I,Beelzebub...,"Beelzebub translated means ""Lord of the Flies.""  I didn't know that until after I finished the book because the precise name of the chaotic god ""Beelzebub"" is never mentioned, although it kind of nicely ties the ideas of the book together.  Incidentally the ""Lord of the Flies"" phrase IS mentioned a few times in the book, in some quite interesting and horrifying scenes that I think are well worth reading.  THOSE dramatic and surreal scenes are what classify this book as a 5-star book instead of a 4-star one.

This book does a great job of creating an atmosphere of confusion, where you, like the children stuck on the island, aren't fully aware of what's going on all the time.  What's the popular phrase?  ""Show, don't tell,"" I think, or something along those lines.  Well, this book tends to suggest in the right places where it doesn't want to fully show, and it actually works quite well.

As I grow older and older, I notice us adults quite often act like kids, and even though there is a noticeable difference between the mentality of someone who's mature in his thinking and someone who isn't, often personality is a huge contributor to that as well as age.  We've all heard of grown adults before that are worse savages than the tribe on the unnamed island and don't even have the basic sensibility of the typical 12-year-old Ralph and are highly incapable of feeling shame for uncivilized behavior.  Hopefully they're still in the minority.  Because if they aren't, it won't be long before this fictional novel becomes not-so-fictional.  That's why the New York Times book review gives us a warning about the book approaching close to reality.  Us being anonymous on the internet actually kind of reminds me of the loss of identity behind the face paint that the tribe of savage kids uses.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3B73UQEFY66I,theboombody,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/1088e0ed-e22e-427c-a967-582f84653be5._CR1,0,97,97_UX110_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on March 30, 2024",True,,0399501487,,,

678,RQ5YW6OZ1E4GD,This book keeps it real about money. It covers EVERYTHING!...even talks about prenups!!(whoa!),"First, let me start off by saying that I've read a lot of different books on personal finance. So I'm very familiar with Dave Ramsey's method of personal finances and a bunch of others. I've read tons of articles, blog posts, etc... on paying off debt and investing, etc...

So this topic isn't new to me.

So when I got this book (I got an advanced copy of it)I was figuring that I would read this book and probably wouldn't learn anything new.

I was thinking ""ohhhkaaay...so it's gonna probably talk about how to get out of debt by reducing your spending to almost nothing, eat beans, rice and ramen noodles...cut coupons..and do this for several years then you'll be able to start living your life""

I figured it would be the same old information that I've read in all the other personal finance books....yaaawn!

Boy oh boy...was I ever wrong

I honestly have to say, that this book was the complete opposite of everything I've ever read.

For you parents, it's like having two kids.

You know..your first child is usually calm, relaxed, quiet, well mannered and well behaved.
Then you have child #2...expecting things to be pretty much the same...only to find out your second child is the complete opposite
Child #2 is a wild child.  Crazy, loud, eats dirt...touches the bathroom handles in public washrooms and then the next minute has their fingers in their mouth

Well, Ramit's book is like your second child.
LMAO.

It's fun and actually really interesting to read! ( I know...I know..who says that about a dry topic like paying off debt, investing and saving?).
It'll make you laugh in some parts(fo real!).
And...it gets you motivated and makes you want to start taking action as soon as you've finished the chapter
He gives you action steps at the end of each chapter that you can start implementing right away!

And...it's real! He keeps it sooo real that he even talks about his discussion with his wife when bringing up the topic of having a PRENUP!! (ohhhh snaaaapp!! ...bring out the popcorn cuz it's about to go down!!)
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

Ok...so here's what I really liked about this book and thought was friggin awesome!

[1. Conscious Spending]

Ok...so we've all heard about ""having a budget"". And when we hear that..we automatically think ""cut back on everything. Use water instead of milk in your cereal. Grow your own coffee beans at home in your backyard and make your own coffee to save a couple of dollars a day""...right?

But Ramit goes about this in a TOTALLY different way. And I love his approach to it. It's such a small shift in your mindset, but it has a HUGE impact!!

So basically, he's telling you this. Instead of thinking of your budget as a way to cut back and not enjoy life..think of it like a plan.
It's your plan where you are CONSCIOUSLY choosing how to SPEND your money each month.

But not only that... this is YOUR life! And to live a ""rich"" and ""happy"" life - you get to choose to spend on the things that make you happy.
So why not cut back on the things you hate - so that you can spend on the things you love!

As he says in Chapter 4 on Conscious Spending ""conscious spending isn‚Äôt about cutting your spending on everything. That approach wouldn‚Äôt last two days. It is, quite simply, about choosing the things you love enough to spend extravagantly on‚Äîand then cutting costs mercilessly on the things you don‚Äôt love.""
(BOOOM!! MIC DROP!!)

[2. Scripts to use to save you money]

You ever get nervous when calling up a financial company (like your credit cards) and then you don't know what to say.
Maybe you don't know how to negotiate, or you just get nervous and forget what to say.

Well...not to worry.
Ramit gives you WORD FOR WORD scripts that you can use to waive annual fees on your credit cards, and even get fees waived on your bank accounts!

I know...when I read that I was like ""hoollld up..wutcha talkin bout Willis!""

I told you that this book was the complete opposite of other personal finance books. What other personal finance book is giving you exact scripts to use on how to call up your credit card and get annual fees waived?!

It's these small details that the average person wants to know cuz let's be real...who likes paying fees? Right?!

[3. Open and Honest]

What I really liked...which I've never seen before....was the willingness to be open and direct with the reader.
Ramit laid all the cards on the table and he mentions
a. the exact credit cards he uses
b. the exact bank accounts he uses
c. the exact online brokerage account he uses
d. the investments he puts his money in

Who else does that?

But not only that....like I said, he GOES THERE and talks about the very very very touchy and sensitive topic of having a prenup.
In Chapter 9 LOVE & MONEY  - he talks about how he had this difficult conversation with his wife. He also talks about why he decided to do it and should you sign one or not?

Also in this chapter, he covers difficult topics around money like
a. How to help parents who are in debt
b. Should you tell your parents and friends how much money you have
c. Talking Money with your significant other
d. How to handle money when your spouse makes more than you
e. How to handle planning for a wedding
f. Negotiating your salary at work
and more and more...

I'm telling you...Chapter 9 is where it all goes down!
Just keepin it real with ya...this is the stuff that we REALLY want to know about. This is the real life stuff we deal with on a day to day basis that NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT!!

I mean, sure...we want to know how to pay off debt, invest, etc...  But let's be real. That part is boring.

That's like reading the first few chapters of a hot & steamy novel..like 50 shades of gray. It's necessary to build the story, but the REAL juicy stuff happens later on.... and that's the part you want to get to.

We've all had a difficult convo with someone about money (spouse, fiance, boyfriend/girlfriend, etc..)
Don't you wish you knew how to handle it better...well now you will! Now you'll have a plan

[4. He's very specific]

For example, in Chapter 7 he talks about investing. And he recommends setting up your asset allocation using David Swensen's recommendation. Swensen manages Yale's endowment for more than 30 years and has an amazing 13.5% annualized return.
He even gives you the exact percentage's to use

30 percent‚ÄîDomestic equities
15 percent‚ÄîDeveloped-world international equities
5 percent‚ÄîEmerging-market equities
20 percent‚ÄîReal estate investment trusts
15 percent‚ÄîGovernment bonds
15 percent‚ÄîTreasury inflation-protected securities

I like this because it takes the guess work out of it for you
Just do exactly what he's laid out - and boom! You've got a successful investing plan in place.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
WHAT'S DIFFERENT

Here are some things that I found different with this book vs other personal finance books

[1. Focus on Big wins, not small wins]
So for example, instead of chasing small percentages by getting introductory rates for high interest savings accounts, focus on your asset allocation and what you're invested in. Your time is much better spent focusing on that, and it will have much bigger returns in the long run
Ramit continues to remind us that it is better to use your time working on things that will have a big impact on your life (i.e. setting up your automated investing) vs spending hours or days looking for the perfect credit card.

[2. Word for Word Scripts]
As I mentioned, he gives you exact scripts you can use to save money and get fees waived

[3. Automating your finances]
Let's be real..who REALLY enjoys paying bills? Who really enjoys reading over investment statements and managing their money? No one!..that's who! Not even Ramit (he even admits this in the book)

Plus - we're all lazy. We don't really want to set aside time to look at our investments. We say we will...but let's be honest..most of us don't.

So in Chapter 5 - he shows you how to automate your finances so that you can get on with your life. He shows you how to setup a system so that your bills get paid automatically and your investment accounts get funded automatically.

And when it's all setup and done...you basically only have to spend 1hr a month looking over your finances, so that you can get on with the more important things in your life

[4. Conversations around money]

He talks about things that others don't talk about...like the judgement you get from friends and family when you spend money on certain things you like...or how we may judge others on things they spend..but we don't know the full context.

Or I'm sure we've all had that one friend who says to you ""why do you still have that old iphone? Don't you think it's time to upgrade?""

This was very eye-opening to me and it was great to see someone finally be honest and talk about these things. I have never read a personal finance book that talks about these real life situations this way before

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

WHAT IS MISSING

Here are some things I found that were missing from the book

[1. Real Estate Investments]

I'm actually kind of surprised that he didn't talk about investing in real estate (residential or commercial)
This is such a hot topic, and there are TONS of Real estate related TV shows now about flipping homes, or agents finding these multi-million dollar homes for their clients.

I think it's a topic that many people are also interested in.

Also, just based on regular ""street knowledge""...the average person probably has an easier time understanding real estate and owning property vs understanding how the stock market and index funds work.

They probably feel more comfortable with real estate because it's a physical asset, whereas the stock market may feel like black magic to a lot of people.

He talks about Cryptocurrency, so I thought for sure he'd talk about investing in real estate.
But he didn't

I wish he had touched on Real Estate as an investment and mention at least what percentage of your portfolio should be allocated towards real estate and how to go about investing in it in a strategic, methodical manner. Kind of like how he explained how to invest in the stock market

[2. Saving up and paying cash for your car]

I found it odd that he didn't talk about the option of saving up and paying for a car in cash.
He does talk about how to buy a car, but it involves getting a loan.
Which - I found ironic because Ramit is completely against debt.
So it didn't make sense to me why he is telling us to get a loan for a car

He mentions how to save up for other big ticket items (like your wedding, etc..) but he doesn't give you a plan on how to save up for your car and use cash so that you can avoid getting into debt and getting a car loan.

I'm not sure what the reason is behind this...but this was very surprising to me.

[3. Investing in blue-chip stable companies]

Ramit is against picking and investing in individual stocks. He recommends investing in Index Funds instead. And for the average person, I understand why
And..he explains why in the book (Chapter 7)

But - at the same time, I think there could have been an opportunity to mention in the book how to invest in well known, stable, big name companies that have been around for many decades that produce dividends and can be a good addition to your portfolio

I'm not saying that they should make up the majority of your portfolio, but perhaps a small percentage.

Ramit is very methodical - and I believe he could have given some sound advice on some criteria to look at for blue-chip companies that have been around forever, and would be solid investments.

One company that comes to mind that Warren Buffett publicly admits he likes is Coca-Cola. It's not an exciting company but it has a history of being stable and producing dividends for the investor.

MAIN TAKEAWAY FROM THE BOOK

The main theme of this book is all about living your Rich Life
And of course, living a Rich Life will mean different things for different people.
For one person, that might mean always upgrading their seats on a flight to the seats with extra leg room...for another, that might mean always buying the VIP section tickets at concerts but also that person could care less about eating out at lunch so they always pack their lunch.

In Chapter 9 (A Rich Life) ...Ramit says :

""it‚Äôs about not having to think about money all the time and being able to travel and work on the things that interest me.""

this pretty much sums it all up right here.

I realized that life is more about enjoying your money, and using it to do the things that bring you joy and make you happy. Whatever those things are for you. You will have to decide.

I already had a mindset of doing the things I enjoy...but this book helped me to get more clarity on exactly how to do that on a daily basis.

This book helped me to have a plan to set aside a specific amount each month towards things I love. And more importantly, how to NOT feel GUILTY about spending on things I enjoy (like upgrading my seats on flights or buying courtside basketball seats) because I am cutting back on things I don't like as much (like paying a cable bill)

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

WHO SHOULD GET THIS BOOK

This book is for the person who
1. hates manually paying their bills each month
2. wants to have simple and easy investments that they actually understand
3. wants to not feel guilty about spending on things they love
4. wants an easy to understand plan on how to pay off debts and still enjoy life (without eating ramen noodles and cutting coupons)
5. wants tips for having real life awkward conversations with friends and family about money
6. wants to enjoy their money and know that in the background their money is growing and they will have enough to retire
7. is tired of the regular boring personal advice that they've read for years and years

Ramit's approach is like that one friend who tells you how it is. They call you out on your B.S. and you appreciate them for it cuz they always keep it real with you and you know that they want nothing but the best for ya.

If you like that quality in people, then you will most definitely enjoy this book!

also...just being honest...I would've given it 4.5 stars, but there was no way to do so. I think 5 stars is for absolute perfection
And since Ramit left out the topic of Real Estate Investing, he didn't discuss the option of saving up and paying cash for a car and I think he could've touched on investing in blue chip stable companies - I would say it's 4.5 stars (in my opinion)

It's still an awesome book and by far the best most COMPLETE book I've read on personal finances because it handles those real life topics around money that happen to all of us, but no one else is talking about.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQ5YW6OZ1E4GD,Goodie7,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2019",True,"1,006 people found this helpful",1523505745,,,
679,R2SSMQ2FLIM4XG,My favorite book - nothing has compared so far!,"This is my favorite book that I return to over and over again. It is the one I gift the most frequently to friends, family, and recent grads. From my own experience, I disagree about this book not being for people under 20 (while simultaneously agreeing, so let me explain).

I read most of the book when I was 18 as an undergrad and revisited a couple time till I graduated college and got my teaching credential at 25. I both read and scanned, sometimes without fully comprehending and without being able to implement, well, really any of the recommendations. And yet, the guidance was still super useful because I didn't make financially unsavvy decisions that would delay my being able to set up a savvy, automated financial system upon graduation and earning an income.

For example, I saw a lot of my peers making decisions such as buying a new car upon receiving their first paycheck or two because they could afford the payments (or even prior to graduation) - the payments that would put their fixed costs at 90% of their income and cause them to live paycheck-to-paycheck with a ton of stress!!

This book gave me the vague and general understanding of what I was going to try to set up before I had the means to do so, before I was even earning a real income.

It helped me determine and sort out my financial values and figure out how I wanted to live my life.

It helped me choose a financially responsible spouse who also read the book. Ramit's guidance helped us arrive at similar financial values and systems from the start. We're so glad we have the tools to talk about money without stress. We've had many friends speak to us about how they have such a hard time talking about money with their partners because the partner just shuts down about it. We sympathize, and as a result of their transparency about their own struggles, we don't take for granted how empowered we are because of this book. (And how brilliant of Ramit to supplement with his podcast of the same title to listen to couples have these conversations)

The book is easy(ish) to follow. I would recommend just accepting that you won't understand everything the first time through, but I realized later that I understood more than I thought and rereading sections really helped. I love the way it is organized into ""weeks.""

Each ""week"" has steps that are actionable and gave me *the* guide to set up my finances. What's great is you can sort of ""pause"" at certain weeks when it takes longer to set up what you need to. For example, I graduated with about $4,000 in credit card debt. I read on so I know what was coming, but I had to pause after Weeks 1-3 as I prioritized paying off that CC debt (which I did within 4 months). I was able to create a debt payoff plan: I chose to use my student loan grace period to pay off the CC aggressively, then start paying off my student loan debt with minimum payments while building up the funds to open my Roth IRA at Vanguard, and so on.

I automated everything and literally one day looked at my Roth and was like, ""How did I get so much money?!"" And that's on a teacher's and adjunct university lecturer's low pay! I'm not kidding when I say it's almost like it happened by accident - I set up everything immediately after college graduation and never felt like my life was limited or lacking from putting aside money each month. I was able to determine which order to pay things and how to allocate my paycheck. I've been able to keep my fixed costs low and build up a nest egg so I am under little financial stress, even through my periods of low pay and job insecurity.

I just can't say enough good things. Read it now even if you can't implement. Read it even if it doesn't make sense to you (yet!). It's so worth it.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2SSMQ2FLIM4XG,Allison,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2024",True,16 people found this helpful,1523505745,,,

681,R2G0770OIXXATZ,Good Book for a Select Audience,"I've been reading a lot of reviews that blast this book for its focus on younger adults, generalized investment advice, or the omission of some hyper-specific tax code or asset allocations strategy. Some of these are valid critiques, though I think they miss the point of the book. I do think that Ramit should've titled and marketed the book differently to reflect its target audience, but for that audience, the advice is valuable.

As one of those 22 year-old recent college grads who grew up with financially inexperienced parents, this book provided me with excellent foundational knowledge. It's not overly technical (perhaps to a fault), but hammers broad principles that will contribute to financial success: the importance of debt and credit health, making smart investments, and automating your finances. Specific advice about choosing banks, optimizing credit cards, buying cars, etc. is a welcome addition, and even financially literate readers will find a few nuggets in this book to optimize their situation.

The real strength of this book lies in altering your psychological relationship to money. At the end of the day, the concept of ""living outside the spreadsheet"" is what should be emphasized. The goal is not to save and grow money for its own sake, but to accumulate wealth to do things which you enjoy. Reading with the idea that Ramit will provide you with globally optimal investment returns for your particular financial situation is to ignore the core principle of the book itself. Furthermore, following all of his (note: very general) advice should be discouraged. After reading, consideration must be made towards your personal situation and goals -- particularly when deciding how you'll distribute retirement contributions and defer taxes. This book should be the foundation of your financial plan, not the singular piece of literature that informs all your financial decisions.

In spite of its helpful, accessible advice, I can't rate this book more than four stars. As most of the critical reviewers will point out, Ramit spends a significant portion of the book complaining about things or admonishing people for making financial mistakes. The tone of the book swings wildly between breezy and helpful to condescending and arrogant; the brief section on cryptocurrency is an example that comes to mind. There's a general unawareness to his own privilege and a good bit of ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" sentiments, which tend to sound insincere and ignore larger issues that originally place younger people in financial strife. Additionally, a significant chunk of the book is testimonials from readers of the first edition. All told, this book could be about 20% shorter if these were left on Amazon's review page where they belong.

Bottom line: I Will Teach You to be Rich contains invaluable advice for younger, financially inexperienced people in an easily digestible format. The book provides a good foundation for the average person to grow their wealth, ease financial anxiety, and align their money with their personal goals -- just be sure to consult other investment literature after you finish reading. If you can get around the narration and deal with the constant self-advertisement, this book is worth your time and money.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2G0770OIXXATZ,Erik Shirley,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2020",True,16 people found this helpful,1523505745,,,
682,R19NDQN28RL0RE,Refreshing and must read!,"It was refreshing to see a book which is unlike most others. Gives detailed step by step instruction to begin with investing and sustaining it as well. Touches on some other soft elements of how to talk about money with family, friends, spouse, prenups etc. which was new. Having read multiple books and articles, watched multiple videos etc, I find this book to have summarized the key concepts well. The way it is organized is good, however only downside is while you are reading through a concept, the excerpts from other readers or a side story sometimes become a distraction.

683,R3CJQUB2WL8EZN,Nuggets of wisdom,"I've been trying to read more books to expand my financial literacy. I was first introduced to this author when I watched How to Get Rich on Netflix. I didn't initially realize this was a second edition book. The author spends a considerable amount of time talking about what he wrote in the previous edition and how he changed things this time. I was getting infomerical vibes with lots of talking about what he is going to tell you and personal testimonies. I would have preferred if he left all that out and just got to the point.

The author has a strong focus on personal responsibility and gives simple action steps to help you start to get your financial life in order. Although the author's tone is a little obnoxious, I do feel more equipped and empowered to make positive adjustments in my money management, particularly in the area of investments.

684,R2SWZ8S5KKS0AI,Tim Ferris' question...,"Book: I Will Teach You to Be Rich, Second Edition: No Guilt. No Excuses. No BS. Just a 6-Week Program That Works by Ramit Sethi.

I'm a big fan of Tim Ferris and in many of his books and podcasts he asks people a really good question. It's not ""What is your favorite book?"" or ""What are you reading now?"" Which are all good questions and bad questions. I mean honestly, if you are reading a book called Atheism for Dummies and the conversation comes up at church, that is kind of awkward. I would be tempted to not answer honestly.

But Tim asks a great question: ""What is a book that you've gifted frequently?"" This immediately shows that you are a gift giver, generous person and thoughtful too, unless of course you are giving the gift of RL Stine books, then you should be flogged. But I digress.

This is the book that I have gifted high school graduates the most. Over the years I've given at least 5-8 away to them. I don't think they have read it and yet I encourage them to. But it's one of those things that I know one day they will come to me and confess they never read it until now and then they would have to leave and make more money under duress due to the fact they didn't read the book and their financial situation is a mess. But I will sit back and gloat in the wonderful knowledge that they SHOULD have listened but alas, many will not.

The book is a blend of off-kilter, foul language (which is hilarious because these are church families) but overall very good solid financial advice.

I do have more complex questions now (concentrated portfolio positions, special needs trusts), but very few people have those issues.  I will say, though:  one thing that should be included is that the easiest way to manage costs for a wedding is to understand that there is a price per person.  You can dramatically vary expenses by adjusting those two things.  Example:  we chose between Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, and Maryland for our wedding.  We ended up choosing Ohio.  Prices there were far less than prices in two of the other locations and it was easier to plan because one of us lived there.  And that meant that we did not have to limit the number of people we invited.  Instead, we got to invite everyone we care about and have a three day party.  It was great.  And also:  I still have the spreadsheet and could look up exactly how much we spent. We were under budget, so we got to ask the florist to really go crazy with the flowers.
