4,RVMRL1LZW6UIA,Great Sound for a Great Price,"I opened them and they were already charged and ready to go. I used them for the gym and had zero issues with them. The sound quality was good and the touch functionality is great and easy to use. I’d definitely recommend these if you do not want to spend a lot of money on earbuds, they are exactly what you pay: a pair of solid, budget-friendly earbuds. The sound quality is decent  These are both cute and functional. If you have small ears like me, you’ll definitely need the smallest tips, and even then I experience mild soreness after wearing these for extended periods, They’re super cute and the touch controls are useful and intuitive. However, there is no volume control on the earbud which I feel is tough if you’re using these to exercise or during periods when your phone is out of reach. There isn’t much bass, but that’s common in earbuds. If you’re looking for bass, I’d recommend over-ear headphones instead. For what I paid, I’m pleased with what I got These have a better case and much better touch controls, though. The fit is good, The batteries in this thing are amazing - They will play a long time without needing to recharge. Bluetooth connectivity is simple and works great. The touch controls are easy to use, Simple taps and double taps on the buds for volume control and track skipping. I can also access Siri with a long tap. You can also accept calls and end calls with touch control.   I  never have a problem connecting to my devices. These are great work and outdoor activities. Would recommend these for sure.",5,Kay Wilkes,B0D7VRMJ9Y,2023-10-25

15,R33KEEDSF9JWGQ,Better than the rest! Not embarrassing to use,This ring light is really better than the other ring lights and gives off a very concentrated light so that you’re not lighting up the whole restaurant when using it. I love it for videos and selfies and also for product photos. Easy to use right from the box. Great accessories.,5,Amazon Customer,B0D6NKMVMP,2024-07-05
16,R33GF82DGM8104,Great product!,"I honestly Thought this was going to be like the rest but it wasn’t. Not only is it sleek in design, the light is actually really BRIGHT! I have used the cheap ones in the past but they do not get as bright and I love the fact that you don’t have to physically take off and  put on a new filter. It also has a mirror on the back!",5,Nia,B0D6NKMVMP,2024-06-25

I honestly did not believe that lighting would make that much of a difference in a photo, thought I have to admit I have heard fro. T.v. Actors it does. But I seriously did not think it would make me look more photogenic, but I have to admit it did. It is not a blinding, and it doesn’t light up the whole room, it just focuses on the person or persons holding the phone.  It clamps on your phone and it’s as easy as that, or it can screw into a tripod. You can take it with you, albeit it needs to go in the supplied bag so it won’t get scratches on it, but it can very easily be put a purse for selfies at a concert or anywhere you feel the need to take better photos of you and friends.  $30.00 seems like a lot of money to me for a selfie light, but it does do what it sets out to do, which is to make you look good.",5,annette rainville,B0D6NKMVMP,2024-07-11

37,R1XZZEZVO3469O,"‘Caste,’ an election and the resonance of racism below the surface of liberal, progressive America","Review: Caste– The Origins of Our Discontents, by Isabel Wilkerson, 2020, 475 pp., Random House, original published at Urbanitus.com  As the razor-edged finale to a presidential election riven by ambiguity reaches its conclusion, one overarching reality will endure in stark clarity: the bi-polar, cultural disease dividing America into two angry and unforgiving camps.  Rivers of words diagnosing the malady are fast becoming analytical torrents. Recrimination and reaction to its implications are beginning and will accelerate. As with the companion pandemic that has overlaid this red and blue-hued socio-political plague, experts and historians will parse the origins for generations to come.  The rest of us, meanwhile, can do something more immediate. We can read Caste – The Origins of Our Discontents by Isabel Wilkerson, a book published just in August that reorders most of the prisms through which conservatives and liberals alike think about America in its 244th year. Even if not intended as such, this work of anthropology, sociology, psychology, political science, philosophy and history is a deep well of insight, a primer even, into the dynamics that animated the just-concluded vote, and that will surely animate its aftermath.  Implicitly, this book is also about cities, the spaces where the global issues of this moment are being most profoundly tested, from climate change to shelter to migration to policing. It is also in cities, from Austin to Amsterdam to Abuja, where we might hope that the twisting kaleidoscope of a fast-urbanizing world will transform the divisions of caste into a mosaic of equality.  On one level, Caste is about race and racism, an exploration of America’s original sin of slavery that haunts us today in virtually all of our institutions. But race and racism both have a predecessor that we need to better understand if we are to effectively confront the stubborn and subtle resonance of racism below the surface of so much of what passes for progressive rhetoric.  How can Austin, for example, be both the most avowedly liberal city in Texas and the most sharply segregated? A large measure of the answer might be found in that predecessor of race and racism, this phenomenon of caste and casteism.  In fact, the absurd concepts of race and racism are effectively creations of caste, argues Wilkerson. With this insight in hand, she builds on other recent work, going deeply and broadly into a larger realm that connects our history to that of the anti-Semitism in the 1930s that led to the Nazi Holocaust, and to the millennia old caste system of India that brutally stratifies that country today. In the process, Caste expands upon the seminal work of other recent efforts such as last year’s Pulitzer-winning 1619 Project of the New York Times Magazine, and the new book revealing the sanitization of the 1950s and 60s civil rights movement, The Sword and the Shield – The Revolutionary Lives of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. by historian Peniel Joseph.  But Wilkerson also takes her readers backwards to pioneering scholarship in the early 20th Century South by the the Black anthropologist Allison Davis in the 1930s and on to America in the 1940s with the work of Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economic sociologist and Nobel laureate who penned the 1944 classic book An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy.  Weaving this tapestry of history and globe-spanning research together, Wilkerson delivers her own pioneering illustration of how tribal hatreds weaken and impoverish victim and victimizer alike — along with all bystanders.  ‘None of us are ourselves’  “It was in the making of the New World that Europeans became white, Africans black, and everyone else yellow, red, or brown. It was in the making of the New World that humans were set apart on the basis of what they looked like, identified solely in contrast to one another, and ranked to form a caste system based on a new concept called race. It was in the process of ranking that we were all cast into assigned roles to meet the needs of the larger production,” Wilkerson writes. “None of us are ourselves.”  It’s not that Wilkerson neglects the horrors of slavery, or for that matter Nazi evil or Brahmin brutality and domination. From castration of slaves to President Andrew Jackson’s horseback riding with bridal reins made from Native American flesh, to lynchings continuing well into the 20th Century, there is little horror that escapes Wilkerson’s gaze. But it is the subtler and more pernicious diffusion of caste into our relationships, our rules of engagement with one another – and ultimately our national politics – that make Caste indispensable to understanding our own cultural wars and the deepening collateral damage.  “Americans of today have inherited these distorted rules of engagement whether or not their families had enslaved people or even been in the United States,” Wilkerson writes. “Slavery built the man-made chasm between blacks and whites that forces the middle castes of Asians, Latinos, indigenous people, and new immigrants of African descent to navigate within what began as a bipolar hierarchy.”  Wilkerson takes a vivid example from the March 2018 series of bombings in Austin, Texas that killed two people and injured six over 20 days. The first to die was 39-year-old Anthony House, a project manager living in East Austin, killed after he picked up a package that exploded on his porch. Because House was Black, police initially suspected the case might be drug-related or that House might even have accidentally detonated the bomb himself.  “Based on what we know right now, we have no reason to believe this is anything beyond an isolated incident that took place at this residence and in no way this is linked to a terroristic attack,” then-Interim (now permanent) Police Chief Brian Manley told reporters.  Some ten days later, that theory gave way to presumption of a hate crime when another Black and a Latina resident of East Austin, 17-year-old Draylen Mason and 75-year-old Esperanza Herrera, died as they picked up similarly disguised bombs left on their porches. But it was only after two White men in West Austin triggered a bomb by tripwire and were critically injured six days later, and two days after that when a bomb exploded at a FedEx warehouse, that the investigation began to suspect domestic terrorism. That brought in the help of 500 federal agents and the “police now raced at warp speed,” Wilkerson notes. Ultimately police cornered the 23-year-old suspect, Mark Conditt, who blew himself up as they closed in.  Manley did finally label Conditt a terrorist, but Wilkerson asks, what might have been the outcome if the caste-blinded police had warned the public initially about the threat of randomly dropped packages instead of waiting 10 days?  “People can come to disregard the predicaments facing people deemed beneath them, seeing their misfortunes as having no bearing on their own lives, seeing whatever is happening to them as, say, a black problem, rather than a human problem, unwittingly endangering everyone.”  ‘The dominant caste around which all other castes revolve’  It is this all but hidden taxonomy of rank and status guiding our actions, in ways most of us are scarcely aware of, that is the great choreographer of decision-making in American and other societies, Wilkerson argues of her research that took her to Berlin to understand the rankings of “Aryan purity” in the 1930s and throughout India to examine the workings of India’s intricately complex caste system today.  “A caste system centers the dominant cast as the sun around which all other castes revolve and defines it as the default-setting standard of normalcy, of intellect, of beauty, against which all others are measured, ranked in descending order by the physiological proximity to the dominant caste,” she writes.  This understanding of caste explains why recent immigrants from Africa have reversed the practice of earlier “middle castes,” say Italians or Jews from Eastern Europe, who quickly changed their surnames to assimilate as quickly as possible into the dominate Anglo-Saxon caste;  Binghenheimer becoming Bingham or Rossellini becoming Ross.  Immigrants from Ghana or Grenada cannot so easily join the presumed dominant caste for the obvious reasons of skin color. So they must take pains to isolate themselves from the bottom-rung of African-Americans, maintaining distinctive accents, dress and names, or in some cases even discouraging their children not “to act like African Americans.”  Wilkerson quotes the late and greatly esteemed Indian jurist B.R. Ambedkar, who rose from his Dalit, or “Untouchable,” origins to become the author of India’s constitution and anti-caste campaigner: … “each caste takes its pride and its consolation in the fact that in the scale of castes, it is above some other caste.”  Which, moving toward today’s political reality in America, explains why so many journalists and analysts were, and remain, blindsided by Donald Trump’s support from working class Whites in 2016 and now. And perhaps it is insight into his surprise support in 2020 from some Black males despite support of White supremacists, or the votes for Trump from Latinos in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley despite the wall, the family separations, and the ugly characterizations of migrants.  “The liberal take was that working class whites have been voting against their interest in supporting right-wing oligarchs, but that theory diminishes the agency and caste-oriented principles of the people,” Wilkerson says. “Many voters, in fact, made an assessment of their circumstances and looked beyond immediate short-term benefits and toward, from their perspective, the larger goals of maintaining dominant caste status and their survival long term.”  And while caste may take its largest toll on African Americans, through unending police brutality, biased outcomes in court, and the world’s highest incarceration rates, its insidiousness leaves few untouched. It is in fact the dictates of caste that lock all Americans into the worst health care and basic education systems of any developed nation and a growing chasm of income inequality that rewards 1 percent of Americans with more than all the assets of the entire bottom half.  In short, our caste consciousness has led us to a point where for some a place high in the American caste system has more value than health insurance, a living wage, political instability, protection from a virus, or threats from overseas.  ‘The susceptible group sees itself in the narcissistic leader’  And in a kind of analytical crescendo, Wilkerson brings that dissection of caste right up to what might prove the most durable understanding of the headlines of recent days. For this she turns to the work of Eric Fromm, the late German Jewish psychologist who saw firsthand, and later wrote about, the connection between the pain, anxiety and insecurity of 1920s Weimar Germany and how it fed narcissistic narratives of racial greatness and superiority among the German population that were to nurture and sustain their embrace of a narcissistic leader.  “The right kind of leader can inspire a symbiotic connection that supplants logic,” Wilkerson argues. “The susceptible group sees itself in the narcissistic leader, becomes one with the leader, sees his fortunes and his fate as their own.”  She quotes Fromm himself, who fled the Nazis to the United States and who died in 1980: “The greater the leader, the greater the follower… The narcissism of the leader who is convinced of his greatness, and who has no doubt, is precisely what attracts the narcissism of those who submit to him.”  A single book will hardly resolve the ancient hatreds and divisions of caste and all the destruction they have wrought. A single election, whatever the outcome, will hardly heal the fears and resentments of a dominant caste that have created a society turned against itself. But without the promise of both, as wildfires burn, glaciers melt and cities erupt in violent standoffs, hope for the species seems slight.  “A world without caste,” suggests Wilkerson, “would set everyone free.”",5,David Judson,B0D9JXR3BH,2020-11-16
38,R2ZI2DAQHW05PO,What is still missing,"This is a wonderful book, well-researched and beautifully written. But like all complex statements, it is not comprehensive enough. There are important topics that must be included in order for the author’s claims to be fully  substantiated, and the most important one is the concept of COLOR as the foundation of American untouchability, and the fact that color as the measure of untouchability was introduced, both in India and in America, by the same white Anglo-Saxon forces that established themselves as the superior caste in both continents. The author mentions the Anglo-Saxons only twice, and there is no separate entry for them in the Index. In fact, there is very little research on the fact that this particular group of people, the Anglo-Saxons, seem to have a special animus against people of dark complexions. They are the only ones who discriminate against blacks in both India and America. The Spanish didn’t, the Portuguese didn’t, the Belgians didn’t, the Germans didn’t; only the British Anglos-Saxons did, and with a vengeance. Why? This fact must be researched for the author’s thesis to be conclusively established.  The second item is also a matter of fact. While untouchability did, indeed, exist, it was sometimes violated with impunity. This happened often in India among Christians, and in America, among the white owners who raped their black women slaves and did not feel polluted thereby, nor was their superior status diminished. Some research should be devoted to this fact, for, after all, Thomas Jefferson loved Sally Hemmings and did not considered himself polluted by their relationship.  I arrived in India in 1951, four years after Indian Independence from Britain.  As a foreigner, I would have been untouchable, but the Indian Constitution banned untouchability. I dined with mahârâjas and shook Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s hand. Ambedkar’s mission was in full force then, but untouchability still reigned in the villages, as it still does, more than seventy years after Gandhiji said, “I’d rather that Hinduism died than that untouchability survived.”",4,Ignacio L.

39,R2LDYQAASNAY9M,An Imperfect but Immensely Valuable Book,"To the old adage ""never just a book by its over,"" I add ""never judge a book by its first ten pages."" Isabel Wilkerson begins her book by discussing the political ascendancy of Donald Trump, and rehashing some of the oft-repeated but largely untrue accusations about him that I thoroughly debunked in my book Trumped-Up Charges!.  https://www.amazon.com/Trumped-Up-Charges-Mexicans-Rapists-Criminals/dp/B087L8B6GB  I assumed there would be other incorrect information throughout the book, but I was happy to be wrong.  First, Wilkerson is evidently a gifted and compelling storyteller. As much as I hate long reads (this one's about 400 pages), she kept me interested throughout.  This is a fantastic book for anyone who thinks the race problem in America was cured the moment Barack Obama was elected president.  But even an old dog like me, born and raised in a multiethnic neighborhood in NYC, learned a few new things. For instance, I never before realized the extent to which other ethnic minority immigrant groups in the United States helped themselves be more white by differentiating themselves from black Americans.  Wilkerson does make some leaps: she thinks Obama was elected because his is not a traditional African-American story. Not so. Colin Powell's was, and he would've been elected in a landslide in 2000, had he chosen to run.  But a few conclusion-jumps here and there do not diminish from this fine tome. I recommend it, as it will be an eye opener to most.",5,Constantinos E. Scaros,B0D9JXR3BH,2024-03-08

42,R1YOZ541ZSH6YZ,There is much here to be learned,"It seems we live in a caste society.  This is the message of ""Caste: The Origins of our Discontent"" by Isabel Wilkerson, a Pulitzer Prize winning author.  She cites a number of sources to support her thesis, the most compelling by historian Nell Irvin Painter, who says simply and succinctly: ""Americans cling to race as the unschooled cling to superstition.""  The author also makes the point that racial prejudice is not healthy.  Indeed, she cites clinical evidence that harboring racial hatred can shorten your life, and ultimately kill you.  At 388 pages the book is not overly long, and reads quite well.  However, as well as the author makes her points, she often overstates the case, with repeated stories that after awhile become tiresome.  Having said that there is much here to be learned, and I recommend the book heartily.  Certainly, our nation has been long divided over race, dating back to 1619, when the first slave ship made port in Point Comfort, Virginia, and unloaded about twenty chained Africans, destined for slavery.  Up to this point the concept of ""white"" and ""black"" people was unknown.  The colonies were comprised of Europeans (mostly Englishmen) who did not think of themselves as white. And the arriving African slaves did not think of themselves as black, but as Igbo. Yoruba, Ewe Akan, and Ndebele.  White people and black people were concepts that developed over time.  Writes the author: ""There developed a caste system, based on what people looked like, an internalized ranking, unspoken, unnamed, unacknowledged by everyday citizens even as they go about living their lives adhering to it and acting upon it subconsciously to this day.""  She adds, ""Caste is not a term often applied to the United States.  It is considered the language of India or feudal Europe.  But some anthropologists and scholars of race in America have made use of the term for decades.""  Indeed, the idea of ""race"", is a recent phenomenon in human history.  It dates back to the start of the transatlantic slave trade and thus to the subsequent caste system that arose from slavery.  The word ""race"" likely derived from the Spanish word ""raza"" and was originally used to refer to the ""caste or quality of authentic horses, which are branded with an iron so as to be recognized,"" wrote the anthropologists Audrey and Brian Smedley.  As Europeans explored the world, they began using the word to refer to the new people they encountered.  ""Ultimately, the English in North America developed the most rigid and exclusionist form of race ideology,"" say the Smedleys.  ""In the American mind (race) was and is a statement about profound and unbridgeable differences (that) conveys the meaning of social distance that cannot be transcended.""  Geneticists and anthropologists have long considered race as a manmade invention, with no basis in science or biology.  In fact, the term ""Caucasian"", a label often ascribed to people of European descent, is a word invented by a German professor of medicine named Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, who was so taken with the shape of a human skull he found in the Caucasus Mountains of Russia, that he applied it to the people he believed descended from there and settled in Europe.  About two decades ago, an analysis of the human genome established that all human beings are 99.9 percent the same.  Concludes the geneticist J. Craig Venter: ""We all evolved in the last 100,000 years from the small number of tribes that migrated out of Africa and colonized the world.""  Which means the entire racial caste system--the catalyst of hatreds and civil war--was built on what anthropologists now call ""an arbitrary and superficial selection of traits,"" derived from ""a few of the thousands of genes that make up a human being.""  In other words, it is based on a lie.  As slavery took hold in the Southern colonies, slaveholders began looking to the Bible for justification of their ""peculiar institution"" and, while conveniently ignoring Jesus's Sermon on the Mount, turned their attention to the Old Testament and learned that back in the Middle Ages some interpreters had described Noah's son, Ham, as bearing dark skin, and thus translated Noah's curse against him as a curse against the descendants of Ham--against all humans bearing dark skin.  They took further comfort from Leviticus, which exhorted them, ""Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are around you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.""  They took as further license to enslave those they considered religious heathens, to build a new country out of the wilderness. Thus, a hierarchy evolved in the New World they created, one that set those with the lightest skin above those with the darkest.  ""The curse of Ham is now being executed upon his descendants,"" wrote Thomas Cobb, a leading Confederate and defender of slavery.  ""The great Architect had framed them both physically and mentally to fill the sphere in which they were thrown.  His wisdom and mercy combined in constituting them thus suited to the degraded position they were destined to occupy.""  Writes the author: ""The United States and India would become, respectively, the oldest and the largest democracies in human history, both built on caste systems undergirded by their reading of the sacred texts of their respective cultures.  In both countries, the subordinate castes were consigned to the bottom, seen as deserving of their debasement, owing to the sins of the past.""  It would take a civil war, the deaths of three-quarters of a million soldiers and citizens, the assassination of a president, Abraham Lincoln, and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to bring an end to slavery in the United States.  Still slavery would live on in a new form of discrimination--white supremacy.  The white supremacists devised a labyrinth of laws to hold the newly freed people on the bottom rung ever more tightly, while a popular new pseudoscience called eugenics emerged to justify the renewed debasement.  People on the bottom rung could be beaten or killed with impunity for any breach of the caste system, like not stepping off the sidewalk fast enough--or in trying to vote.  When Hitler and his band of thugs took power in Germany and focused their hatred toward European Jews, who should they turn their attention to for guidance?  To the discriminatory race laws of the Jim Crow south.  According to Yale legal historian James Whitman, in debating ""how to institutionalize racism in the Third Reich, the Nazis began by asking how the Americans did it.""  PUTTING AN END TO CASTE  Writes the author: ""The caste system in America is four hundred years old and will not be dismantled by a single law or any one person, no matter how powerful. We have seen in the years since the civil rights era that laws, like the Voting Rights Act of 1965, can be weakened if there is not the collective will to maintain them . . .  ""Caste is a disease, and none of us is immune.  It is as if alcoholism is encoded into the county's DNA, and can never be declared fully cured.  It is like a cancer that goes into remission only to return when the immune system of the body politic is weakened . . .  ""To imagine an end to caste in America, we need only look at the history of Germany. It is living proof that if a caste system--the twelve-year reign of the Nazis--can be created, it can be dismantled.  We make a serious error when we fail to see the overlap between our country and others, the common vulnerability in human programming, what the theorist Hannah Arendt called ""the banality of evil.""  ""What's most disturbing about the Nazi phenomenon,"" writes philosopher David Livingston Smith, ""is not that the Nazis were madmen or monsters.  It is that they were ordinary human beings.""  Note: While preparing this review, I came across this quote by Nelson Mandela: ""No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or background or his religion.  People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can learn to be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.""  Mandela, it will be remembered, was elected as South Africa's first black head of state. Under his watch, the government focused on dismantling the legacy of caste (a.k.a. apartheid) by tackling institutionalized racism and fostering racial reconciliation.",5,Ricardo Mio,B0D9JXR3BH,2021-01-20
43,R3L0KZSGR28HCD,Aryan influence vis-a-vis India,"This is another good one from Ms. Wilkerson. She writes about caste from the perspective of three countries; United States, Germany and India. I don’t know why she did not include the treatment of Aboriginals in Australia.  Truth hurts and this is a disturbing book to read about the hopelessness and the unimaginable inhumane treatment of Blacks in the US, Jews in Germany and Dalits in India.  While here in America, people of color especially blacks continue to suffer, she writes quite a bit concerning how Germany is presently dealing with the atrocities of the past, but she omits to mention the progress India has made since its independence from colonial rule vis-a-vis the dalits. Yes, she makes fleeting reference to this progress. Today there are around 300 million dalits in India.  Caste in India is complex.  While in America caste is a deliberately imported happening beginning with slave trade, in India it was forced by the Aryans who came in from central Asia.  The tall and fair skinned Aryans, the hardy nomads of the grasslands who called themselves ‘noble ones’ entered India around 1500 BCE  through the Hindu-Kush mountains in northwest India. Before this invasion, a well-developed, prosperous and widespread civilization dating back to third millennium BCE of the Indus Valley in the twin cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro (now both are being excavated in the present day Pakistan) of dark skinned people called Dravidians was already flourishing.  With the Aryan invasion began the clash of cultures. The Aryans brought with them the oldest living language ‘Sanskrit’ which they meant ‘language of the cultured’ and the scriptures called the ‘Vedas’ which they said were god made, (‘shrutis.’) They considered the dark skinned conquered Dravidians inferior to them.  For socio-economic purposes, the Aryans divided the society probably based on the color of the skin; priests, warriors, traders and workers and said they were God sanctioned and through their man made (smritis) book of law ‘Manusmiriti’ institutionalized this caste system.  The first three in the system belong to the upper caste which the Aryans kept for themselves. The last one, the workers or laborers called ‘sudras’ of dark skin were classified as belonging to the lower caste and it is believed that they were the locals conquered by the Aryans. Manusmiriti is very harsh in the treatment of the sudras.  Below the sudras are dalits who did menial work such as cleaning lavatories, sweeping roads, burying the dead etc., were kept outside this system and suffered even more than sudras. Due to the fault lines of caste in Hinduism, three great religions ‘Buddhism’ ‘Sikhism’ and ‘Jainism’ rose in India.  To escape prejudices and discrimination from everywhere including from their own communities, dalits tried to find social acceptance by converting to Buddhism, Christianity, Sikhism and Islam.  Ms. Wilkerson writes about the brilliant Bhimrao Ambedkar, a dalit who fought admirably for their rights.  He was the architect of the constitution of India and dalits were brought into the mainstream under Article 341 of the Indian constitution and listed as ‘Scheduled Castes’ that afforded them special benefits under affirmative action aka ‘reservations’ initiatives of the government they so deserved thereby including them in the Hindu fold.  Caste discrimination was outlawed. Although Ambedkar was a dalit, he was made the first Minister of Law and Justice of independent India.  He embraced Buddhism helping mass conversions of dalits.  Many reformers rose within Hinduism.  The Bhakti movement that developed long ago was precisely to address the inequities in the Indian caste system including those pertaining to the untouchable dalits.  Mahatma Gandhi during his freedom struggle gave the untouchables a new name ‘Harijan’ meaning ‘Children of God’ and brought over seventy million of them into mainstream Indian life.   Any reference to the current caste system in India should be judged from the footmarks of history and the sufferings of the Hindus as a whole under 400 plus years of foreign occupation, first from the muslim invaders and secondly by the European British colonial masters. While the muslims were engaged in forced mass conversions of Hindus to Islam, the British exploited the divisions within the society and bankrupted the country not only economically but even stole the dignity of the people to their advantage.  According to the erudite member of the Congress party Shashi Tharoor, the British rule reduced India from its glory of one of the richest countries in the world to the poorest one and its claims of bringing development and political unity was false. Under the British, India in 1858 was one of the richest countries in the world with a share of 23 percent of global GDP.  When they left in 1947 the GDP was just around 4 percent.  In the meantime to add insult to injury, the caste based society started slowly changing to ‘class’ based society which is still happening today.  Only since 70 years after India gained independence from the British and inherited an empty shell of a once proud and prosperous nation, efforts are continuing by successive governments to address the inequities in the system to rebuild a country of glory and tolerance that it was once.  While here in the US even today Blacks are being suppressed, in India affirmative actions and more enshrined in its constitution are continuing to improve the lot of the ‘dalits.’  The current President of India, Ram Nath Kovind holds highest office and belongs to a caste that is considered lower than the lowest amongst the dalits.  Another dalit K.R. Narayanan was elected as the president in 1997. Despite the fact that officially the caste system was constitutionally abolished in 1950 when India became a republic, it still has major influence in contemporary Indian society. Yes, dalits are still suffering and no doubt more should be done.  But progress is being made to address their plight at many levels.  A number of non-governmental organizations are actively involved to right the wrong done in the past.  Also, there is a noticeable change in the attitude of the younger people towards the dark skinned sudras and dalits.  Many even do not know a thing like manusmriti existed.  However, India still suffers from its cultural fixation with whiter skins. There are deeply rooted prejudices around skin color. But, the Black Lives Matter movement here in the US has inspired debate.  Evidences of tolerance abound. There is a backlash against multibillion dollar skin whitening creams, powders and lotions marketed for example as Hindustan Uniliver’s ‘Fair & Lovely.’  They cleverly rebranded it as ‘Glow & Lovely.’  It is interesting to note there are controversies relating to the invasion of the Aryans.  Many believe that Aryans were indigenous Indians and the invasion theory is is just a myth. Hindering the progress is the issue of conversion.  Taking advantage of the plight of the dalits, organizations associated with Christianity and Islam are very active in converting them to their religion thereby complicating the divisions within the society.  The religions of Islam and Christianity are considered foreign and hence converted Muslim and Christian dalits are not afforded the same benefits enjoyed by converted Buddhist and Sikh dalits, as Buddhism and Sikhism are considered indigenous.  It should be noted that forced mass conversion of Hindus by the Islamic Moghul invaders who ruled the country for over 200 years resulted in the partition of the country with the birth of Islamic Pakistan which itself was further divided thereby giving birth to Islamic Bangladesh.  Hindus in India are very much concerned about the possibility of further partition based on religion and are therefore paranoid of conversions.  For the benefit of the readers, I wish Ms. Wilkerson devoted some space in the book concerning the history and these efforts in India just as she has vis-a-vis Germany.   For this reason I am giving the book a four star.  I hope Ms. Wilkerson will use her enormous talent and intellect to write a book on European Colonialism that has devastated countries in Africa and Asia for which they take no responsibility even today.",4,Placeholder,B0D9JXR3BH,2020-10-15
44,R3MHMIODOJ2LQJ,"Epic, breathtaking and consumed my every thought","Fourth Wing was epic, breathtaking and consumed my every thought.  This is easily one of my top favorite books, ever.  This book had me screaming from excitement, gasping from betrayal, and crying all the happy and sad tears. Foreshadowing of what was to come was secretly laced into the pages, leaving us with the feeling of dread that was all consuming. The betrayals cut deep. The friendships were beautiful. The enemies to lovers romance was a slow burn that was passionate and steamy. And the battles were intense and epic. If you love romantasy, you definitely need this one on your tbr!  Violet Sorrengail is one of my favorite heroines.  She was smart, cunning and brave.  She was so easy to connect to and feel all of her emotions.  She thought she was destined to enter the Scribe Quadrant, but her mother changed her future.  As the commanding general, her mother forced Violet to go to the Basgiath War College.  And there she would either survive and become a dragon rider or die trying like countless others. The trials she went through were gutting, and I found myself cheering out loud for her every step of the way! Violet is a heroine that you can respect and love!  Xanden Riorson was someone that was so easy to obsess over. He was Violet's enemy, because his parents had a rebellion that went against Violet's mom. In punishment, he and the other children of those who rebelled had to attend the Basgiarth War College. Yet by the end of Chapter 7 I was definitely betraying Violet, I was obsessed. Xaden was smart, sly and seemed honorable. His subtle banter with Violet was EVERYTHING! So when Violet would follow through with one his suggestions for training, I was grinning from ear to ear. And when he taught her how to grapple on the mats, it was so hot *fans face*. It seemed like Xaden was trying to protect Violet, yet in her world deception and backstabbing were done without a second thought. So while I was under his spell, I still didn't know whether I could trust him or not. I kept whispering for him not to betray her.  This world was fascinating!  Maybe I was putting the clues together wrong, but it seemed like not everything was as black and white as Violet was taught.  All the while, others around her elicited so many emotions.  It was terrifying not knowing who you could trust.  There were those who had no problem killing a threat, or just killing for fun.  Even the grappling was intense, and I was shocked with my mouth left hanging open over how that would play out.  Broken bones were the least of your concerns. So as people showed their true colors over time, some of that made my blood simmer. But at the same time, be careful who you get attached to. Death found some of them too soon.  One especially I still can't handle, even after finishing this book *sobs*.  The dragons in this book were larger than life! I can't say much, because of spoilers, but the conversations and interactions were spellbinding. Also I loved the friendships that were formed between the humans. They were the type of friendships where you knew they would do anything to protect your life. Which is desperately needed since life and death moments were always present. Throughout this story, there was always this charge in the air that left me terrified of what was to come. And it was impossible not to have sweaty palms during some of the scenes or to feel your heart pounding in your chest! Plus the twists and turns were done beautifully! Some of it I saw coming, but others left me with my mind blown!  With the most epic of last lines, this book left us at the perfect spot where we can breathe. For a bit. Yet you'll still be left desperately wanting to grab that next one! With emotions and tensions running high, this was an action packed ride! The dragons, sparring, battles, political intrigue, friendships, and scorching hot and seductive scenes made this book beyond memorable. It had my whole heart in the palm of its hand and made me cry all the tears! Fourth Wing was beyond addictive and will easily become a favorite for romantasy fans!

46,R3TAV4YKSC6WNU,Could not put it down,"This is a well-written, easily-read, highly-entertaining book with an engaging storyline, relatable characters, a believable heroine, and excellent pacing. From the first page it is clear this was a book written by an experienced author and professionally edited, something one can no longer take for granted with Amazon's self-publishing service. I raced through this book and Book 2, the Iron Flame, in under a week, simply unable to tear myself away from either one. I highly recommend them both and can't wait for book 3. The genre is this new amalgam of romance and sword & sorcery fantasy which seems to be rapidly growing in popularity. The sex scenes may be a bit too explicit for younger teens, depending on your sensibilities as a parent, but were tamer than another well-known author in the genre who tends to go overboard. There's also violence and swearing, but nothing beyond what any older teen hasn't already been exposed to in today's culture. And although I loved both books, the amateur book critic in me found two small, very nitpicky flaws worth mentioning. Both books end on cliffhangers, and while that is common when writing a series, the giants in the field (LOTR and Harry Potter) did a better job of wrapping up each individual book as a separate storyline. The other thing was the author's strange choice of changing the perspective in the last chapter of both books. Both book are first-person narratives from the perspective of the heroine/protagonist. Then the last chapters of each book switch to first-person narratives from the perspective of the second main character. I found this an odd and jarring choice that I hope she abandons for subsequent books (Ms. Yarros, are you listening?) This secondary main character's internal dialogue sounds no different from the protagonist's, and it comes off as gimmicky and frankly confusing. Those minor critiques aside, these are two fantastic books that I hope spawn many more, and I highly recommend them.",5,A. Couto,B0D923QDHR,2024-03-20
47,R1B8HFCJFF2G3M,Totally Captivating!!,"Wow! It has been a LONG time since I have actually felt tension while reading a book. I can read the biggest action scenes at the end of various books and the majority of the time they just don't affect me at all - because I don't care that much about the characters. But THIS - this was different. I felt the tension. And it was real. Plus the author is very willing to kill characters so there is some uncertainty there as well. And the battle at the end of this most excellent book - it was hot and raging. Plus the enemy leaked danger as well. True menace. Very rarely does some enemy in a book impress me at all but this one most certainly did.. Right from the description I just KNEW there was something different about these mages called venin. They seemed impressive too. And very memorable. I wanted to draw them based off of the description. Very rarely do I get that urge.  But what a battle at the end! It was touch and go. What would happen? Would the heroes win or lose? I didn't know. And I felt concern.  This book has made me feel things. Earlier it had made me cry - tears of joy.  And the book has surprised me too. The plot twists! I guess I should have seen it coming but I didn't so I was quite surprised. But it certainly makes the story way more interesting! And I am certainly eager to read the sequel too! This is a massive book and worth reading every word! And rarely do I feel that way. But its exciting and the characters face so many challenges. And there is death too. In fact there is a lot of death in here. Its a very violent world, a tough world of dragons and griffins and things that are supposed to be only legends to scare kids to eat their vegetables...  But what I love the most in here in the main character Violet. She has a connective tissue disorder. I have one too (its called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome - EDS - and I am pretty confident that Violet actually has EDS). I have never run across a character in a book before that has EDS. And certainly not one that is bold enough to be in a fantasy world where she rides a dragon. How cool is that? So yes I certainly can relate to her very well! And so much of the stuff in here is quite accurate too. Exercise is the best way to protect the joints (and personally I find diet matters a ton too). And yes it certainly can make many things way harder. The joints are all wonky and they naturally hyper-extend so doing things - even just balancing - is way harder. But riding a dragon!!! I remember when I was much younger I used to read this other very popular fantasy series that included dragons and I used to try to imagine what it would be like to ride a dragon. Of course I never thought about the issues of staying ON said dragon... But since I ride horses these days I have a better idea of some of the issues. But wow this book is totally AMAZING! it totally captivated my attention. The first evening I started it I got 50% through. And I certainly would have powered through the second half yesterday but unfortunately I have packing to do as I am moving at the end of the month.  If I could I would rate it 6 stars!  The characters are just so real. And they go through character arcs too. They change. They face obstacles and have to find solutions. And there is certainly a bit of romance in here too. The story moved so smoothly. Never a dull moment at all. None. And I just loved the first person writing in here from Violet's viewpoint.  But the story is about a young woman named Violet who has been forced by her very powerful mother to become a dragon rider. That is a warrior. But her body is weak and ill suited for it. So she was training to be a scribe (but all of that writing would be a huge strain on her too - in fact I cannot write very long at all by hand anymore without pain + numbness going down my arm and I get horrid shoulder pain) but that changed - she had to go be a dragon rider or die trying. But its not that easy in fact its very dangerous. Most people who try to become a rider end up dead. And you can be killed by your own classmates! Yes, its a very brutal school. And after all of these difficult obstacles - which Violet is ill suited to pass - she has to hope that a dragon will pick her. But what dragon will pick someone with a body that doesn't work right due to genetic mutations?  And all of that is near the beginning of the book! For a huge mysterious and dangerous problem is brewing in the Kingdom! And poor Violet will run smack into it - err - fly into it. If she can stay on the dragon that is...  You definitely should read this!",5,Sarah B,B0D923QDHR,2024-01-10
48,R3OIM5W64IJ60U,A little to predictable,"So imagine you get dressed up your finest clothing and you’re going to go out to one of the expensive restaurants in town. This restaurant is not cheap it cost more money than the average run of the mail place, but it’s supposed to have superior food.  You get there you have an appetizer you have a meal you have a dessert and you leave feeling like it was average.  That’s how I feel after I read this book. It was just average. Don’t get me wrong. There were some good parts to the story. The beginning was good. The end was good, but there was far too much predictability. I really felt like having I read this sort of similar dragon rider tale before or have I seen these plot points touched upon before.  I could see where certain things were going well before they got there. Not that I predicted everything but too much of this was predictable.  No I did not want to give the book 3 stars so I didn’t go that low, but it deserves about 3.5 stars to be honest.  For the $14.99 I paid for this book digital on Kindle. It cost too much for the story I got.  Here’s the funny thing. I actually want to read the next book in the series. It’s not that it’s a bad story but for $15 it should be a great story and so far it’s just average. There is room for improvement. the characters are nice. I can see this growing into something better but this first book Was not a Homerun.  Message to the author  Spoilers follow warning. Once again, spoilers be warned.  I always write a message to the author when I read a book that is interesting to me. Now I am a fan of the dragon writer genre. I’m a fan of fantasy and LITRPG books so I can get down with any story and I look for the good ones. I saw the reviews I saw the price and I was willing to pull the trigger and pay $15 for this story. I believe authors should be paid properly for their work. I’m a little sad to say the $15 I paid for this digital book doesn’t quite live up to my expectations. The plot was easy to follow. The grammar was perfect and spot on no misspellings. Nothing like that instead I found the story just predictable. It was easy to see who the heroin would bond with. Wow there’s a big dragon she’s going to be with him. It was unexpected that she would get two dragons. There’s a mysterious rebel that wants her dead. I bet they’ll end up a couple. Guess what it happened.  Now the end was not as predictable. I know some people who would’ve thought it was predictable to see him leading a rebellion with the griffins, but I didn’t see that coming perhaps because I wasn’t looking for it, but I didn’t know what would happen at the end truly. However, it was easy to see that her mind had been read as soon as I realized he touched her. I said Dain knows something he shouldn’t. It was easy to see he would be the one to break her trust and do something he shouldn’t. It was also clear someone would die and the only question was would it be Liam or her gf?  The world was a nice world to be in. The characters were nice characters to read about, but they were just too predictable.  One final note the love scenes were well written often I read authors who don’t know how to describe passion in a book, but this was very tasteful. What was repetitive were the feelings that kept being repeated over and over and over and over again. There’s only so many times I want to hear how attracted she is to him. Even when we were given a different mindset at the end of the story man I already knew how attracted he was to her. I didn’t need to hear it so many times it was just too much. I realized they are young teenagers who really want each other, but I don’t need to hear it every five minutes in the book.  I’m a bit unsure if I will purchase the next book in the series, I definitely want to read it since that final scene in the book occurred but I’m a little scared to pay $15. I think the prices for this series needs to be adjusted.",4,jermel purse,B0D923QDHR,2024-06-27
49,R1B8QV3CJCLJ0Z,I can’t believe I waited so long to read this epic book,"Guys. I’m not lying here: 2023 is MY YEAR for reading. I cannot tell you how many books I’ve read that have been so astonishingly beautiful and amazing and overall top tier. This novel is no exception.  Coming into this book, I wasn’t sure what to expect. The only other book I’ve read by Rebecca Yarros is The Things We Leave Unfinished. Also amazing, but if you’ve read it you know it’s on a completely different playing field than this book. I mean, Fourth Wing is on a different world and isn’t a historical romance novel. It is epic, though, and I’m not using that word lightly.  Fourth Wing is a fantasy novel set in the world of Navarre where dragons, griffins, and magic are real. If you’ve followed a majority of my reviews on my blog, you know that I hardly ever review fantasy novels. I honestly think the only other fantasy novel I’ve reviewed was The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue, which honestly was a real world fantasy, so wasn’t that far outside of my realm. With that being said, this book is outside of my typical comfort zone but holy hell did I love it. Now I’m thinking I’ve been missing out on all of these amazing fantasy novels and I might just go on a binge.  So, what exactly did I like about this novel? Everything. But to break it down: the world building that went into writing this is absolutely insane and makes it an amazing read in itself; the characters that don’t necessarily make you think “oh this again” with the main heroine; the unbeatable plot; and the beautiful, comical writing style that Rebecca Yarros demonstrates.  The world building speaks for itself, but the characters that don’t follow typical patterns particularly made me like this novel. For instance, our main heroine, Violet, is way weaker than other riders. She doesn’t fit the mould. While this is typical for our main character, what follows isn’t. Instead of her beating all odds and becoming the strongest rider of all, she basically just… adjusts. She has to do things differently and doesn’t just become a natural born rider. It’s amazing and you’ll know what I’m talking about if you’ve read the book.  The plot is just like what I said: unbeatable. You have foreshadowing, a romantic subplot, tension and high stakes throughout the entire novel, and man is it satisfying.  I’m not sure how long this series is going to be, but I am here for it.  Lastly, Rebecca Yarros’ writing style in this novel is nothing short of spectacular. You get epic battle scenes, romantic moments that play with your heart, and comical snips that make you laugh out loud. It really does have everything and I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire novel.  Overall, this review is huge but I had a lot to say. I honestly can’t even point to something that I disliked about this novel, which just goes to show you how much I loved it and how great I think it is. If you enjoy fantasy novels, you’ll fall in love with this book. If you don’t enjoy fantasy novels? You’ll still fall in love with this book. I’ve already recommended it to my book club, my mom, and my brother. Y’all are welcome.  Favorite quote: “And when others are quick to stand in front of me, Xaden always stands at my side, trusting me to hold my own.”",5,Heidi Dischler,B0D923QDHR,2023-10-06
50,R3CV2Q9A1VRSWI,Gave me an amazing book-hangover!,"I inhaled this book, it was so good! I know people have a lot of opinions about this one. Some people I saw complaining about the lack of world building, but I didn’t see that. I felt that there was world building, it’s just alongside a fast moving plot. And no, it’s not as detailed as some fantasy novels. Other complain that it’s just a mashup of divergent and hunger games. I definitely see that, but I have no problem with it. I loved both those series (except the ending of divergent, which was not ok), and I enjoyed reading something with a similar vibe.  The characters were lovable and complex. The spice was spicy, but didn’t take over the plot like in some spicy books. I really enjoyed reading this book and it gave me the great rush and book-hangover that comes from being completely absorbed in a good book. ??  My only issue was with the disability representation. I loved that the main character has a disability, but I felt like it was only incorporated when it was interesting or convenient. She’s very fragile, and yet she never has bad days, and the spicy scenes are intense and somewhat violent, and yet she has no problems with it, isn’t accidentally injured. That seemed somewhat unrealistic. As a person with disabilities, I wish that part had been treated with a bit more realism.",5,Samantha,B0D923QDHR,2024-05-15
51,R31AUW1SOGRSNI,"So Much Cringe, But High Entertainment Value","You turned oranges into a weapon, Violence? - Xaden Riorson  High fantasy, dragons, and an enemies-to-lovers romance in a world wrought with war? YES PLEASE! Okay, let's start at the beginning, the part before I even start reading the book. Fourth Wing is everywhere: Bookstagram, BookTok, everyone and their mother AND brother have read Fourth Wing. I was interested. I had been putting it off for fear that it would disappoint. Well...when I started reading, I was thinking ""Yeah, a nice new young adult fantasy with dragons. I hope it's as good as Eragon!"" Yes, I know I know...I found out very quickly that this is an adult fantasy and definitely NOT young adult. I could tell by the type font and layout, as if the sexuaI innuendos weren't enough right from the get-go! And man...were some of then so cringy. What force on this planet made me even think it was young adult?!   Some of the innuendos and just the bickering, bantering type of dialogue was so cringy and awful that I had to read parts aloud to my husband for a serious laugh. It was like twelve-year-olds who have heard about $ex but haven't experienced it trying to talk about it. It was awful. Cringy. So terrible that I was affronted that I was still enjoying the book! One of the lines I remember most was something like ""I want to climb him like a tree."" Okay. I get what she means...but if you picture that particular simile...what DOES that even mean? There were better choices out there than...a tree...?????  Cringe aspect incoming: While I love a good enemies-to-lovers trope, in fact one of my favorites, the way this was set up made the characters feel flatter than paper. We have our main character, Violet, whose small size is constantly emphasized for a good portion of the novel. Yes, thank you for telling us for the FORTIETH TIME that she is small and petite. Point taken. Cool. She is also warned early on about the traitor son, Xaden Riorson, who from the moment he sees her, emphasizes his need to kill her. Except...every time he has the chance, there's some dumb excuse as to why he didn't. And then all of a sudden, he's saving her from death MUTIPLE times, and then they are kissing. ?? This is all well and good, or would be, IF there was more to the enemy aspect. There should have been more time taken to explore Xaden's own hatred of Violet, and vice-versa.  At least it gets better. After about halfway through the book (roughly page 250), the cringe isn't there anymore. It's like the author became a better writer AS she was writing. The (human) characters finally started getting some dimension to them, and the cringe-worthy dialogue (with one exception about measuring size, though it's placement wasn't too bad) was no longer present. We finally get a little bit of Xaden's hatred-turned-passion toward Violet, but still not enough to see why he would want to kill Violet, as opposed to attempting to kill her mother, the main responsible party for his misery, instead. I know there will be more books to explore this later, but to make the true enemies-to-lovers feel, and for it to feel genuine, there should have been a bit more from the start.   What truly makes this book shine is the dragons. Absolutely everything about the dragons. The series is named after their mysterious governing council (or what it is perceived as, though may be something else entirely), the Empyrean. The dragons are intriguing characters who all deserve more page time, especially Andarna and Sgaeyl, as well as the secondary characters dragons, which we don't get to see a whole lot of. With the dragons having their own governing system and being respected as the highest of beings, they certainly deserved more. The dragons also channel magic into their riders, and each rider manifests their own unique power based on their inner self. The magic system is enjoyable and works well for this world.  There are two parts about the book that absolutely make it phenomenal: Threshing, and the last 50 pages of the novel.  Threshing is the day when riders get to go out into the field and try to bond with a dragon. The dragon must pick the rider, of course, and not the other way around. No spoilers, but this scene comes somewhere between pages 120-180ish and is the part of the novel that truly had me hooked. I couldn't put it down!   The last 50 pages of the novel are the exciting battle one waits for in this kind of book. Once again, no spoilers, but with references throughout and the multiple reveals during this stretch of reading make for an action-packed cliffhanger ending making the reader itch for more. I don't even know where this story will go from here. I know whatever happens, I'll be along for the ride and I know I'll have my wildest imaginings blown out of the water.  Final consensus:  ??????? Why? Overall, the entertainment value of this novel has great sway in my final rating. Despite complaining about cringey aspects, they offered great laugh-out-loud moments. Despite the flat characters at first, they definitely fill out a bit more later, and the thing is, one can't hate on that. It's only the beginning of the story (my understanding at the time of this blog post is that it is planned as a five book series). That dragons truly make this book phenomenal, and everything about the last 50 pages really brought this novel to become something more, to put forward the promise to an exciting war story with its fair share of romance...and loss. Yes...I even teared up a bit at one part. No matter what anyone tells you about the book, its entertainment value makes for a FIVE STAR DIAMOND of a novel... i.e. a MUST READ for all fantasy lovers and seekers of a top-tier book with dragons.",5,Terri,B0D923QDHR,2024-06-25
52,RMLG5BBD2CJAQ,I NEED THE SEQUEL RIGHT MEOW!,"John Palladino, author of the grimdark fantasy series, The Tragedy of Cedain, picked this book for me to read. He said he'd heard a lot of people say good things about it, but the people he trusted absolutely hated it. He wanted to know what I thought. So here we are.  What do I think? I started this book and became obsessed. For the three days it took me to read it, I was either curled up in my chair physically reading it or suffering through the audiobook when I had to actually get up and function as an adult.  I would recommend reading this one physically, if possible. I had the good fortune to land both FOURTH WING and IRON FLAME in hardback during a sale in recent months. As is my habit, I checked out the audiobook from my library so that I could pair the two together. Rebecca Soler is the narrator and I did not enjoy her narration at all. Well - there is one exception - during certain scenes, Soler did match the pacing of the scene with her narration, and infused it with emotion that I felt truly captured the intensity of the moment. So there's that.  I loved so many of the characters in this story. Even though the book description warned me that the only way to leave this war college was to graduate or die, I still fell in love with these kids and rooted for them to conquer each challenge faced and survive to the end. It may surprise you fantasy readers out there to know that I favored the human characters over the dragons in this book. Don't get me wrong - the dragons were magnificent and I loved learning the little bits of history they shared and most especially loved learning about their magic and how it changed, based on their chosen Rider. It's been two days since I finished the book and I'm still in the horrible throes of a book hangover. (Thank goodness I already have the next book on hand to start soon!)  What I loved most about FOURTH WING was the setting. Even though there were a few deaths - one in particular - that devastated me, I wouldn't change a thing. This war college where young adults enter with the intent to become a Dragon Rider had a staggeringly low success rate. First, you have to survive the entrance to the Rider Quadrant. If you successfully navigated that, you were officially a cadet. Cadets then began their first year of training where they must survive challenges, training, education, fellow students and even the dragons! Just because you completed everything to a point, the dragons could reject you. (Hopefully by simply ignoring you and not with fire)  I was engrossed with the magic that was bestowed upon the Riders from their dragons. The dragons were able to channel magic through their bond to the Rider and the abilities manifested in different ways, depending on the Rider. Who the Rider was at their core - the kind of person they were - matched their magical abilities. I know the magic in this book was just brushing the surface, so I'm looking forward to continuing the series to see how it continues to build and seeing if the Riders' magic evolves further.  Obviously, this is a fantasy romance, so I feel like I should mention my opinion on the love story between our main characters. I liked it! It felt like the type of romance a couple of young 20-somethings would have, especially in a setting where they literally might not survive the day. It was quick, full of fire and flat out consuming. So many rant reviews I've seen focus on the ""horny dragons"" - I'm confused why people picked out that one scene that only took up a couple pages and what happened between the dragons took place off the page. I mean, how else do you think baby dragons get made?  In closing, I had a great time with this book and CANNOT wait to get started on the sequel. I'm at war with myself because I want to read it immediately, but then I also want to wait a bit closer to when the next book releases in early 2025. Decisions, decisions!",4,The Nerdy Narrative,B0D923QDHR,2024-05-17
53,R1LETQO4R3K7IR,4.5 Stars,"One Sunday, I was visiting blogs, which I don't get to do very often, and stumbled upon one that caught my eye. I can't remember the exact wording, but the blogger stated they didn't enjoy a book that was getting a ton of buzz and love. However she worded her comments piqued my interest, so I looked up the book on Goodreads and decided almost instantly that it sounded like something I would like. I added it to my wish list, and Husband bought it for me for my birthday. I still put off reading it for a while because I needed to focus on review books first. I finally found time to pick it up, and I have to say that I didn't want to put Fourth Wing down. We never have lazy days where we just let the kids watch TV all day, but Husband wasn't feeling well, it was 101 degrees outside, and I was enthralled. So I read every chance I got that first day and read about 80% by midnight. I needed to sleep because I knew that was too much to finish at a reasonable time for me. And I finished the other 20% the next day.  Fourth Wing has everything you could want from the first release in a new fantasy series. You have a flawed leading character--Violet is fragile. Her bones break easily, her joints and ligaments are weak as well. She is short. And generally not physically strong. She is, however, brilliantly intelligent. She spent her entire life training to go to the scribe quadrant. But her mother, one of the nation's top military leaders, decrees that Violet will enter the dragon rider's quadrant instead.  The rider's quadrant is a vicious school of tests and challenges that will end with more cadets dead than alive. Often times the tests kill the cadets. Just as often, the other cadets will do the killing. And what deaths remain are likely from the dragons themselves! Unique schools like this are why series like Harry Potter, Vampire Academy, Divergent, Red Rising, and even Throne of Glass have been wildly popular and universally loved.  And I mean dragons! The appeal of these mythological creatures is fascinating. Perhaps because they're imaginary, we love the different iterations of dragons throughout various literature and media. Fourth Wing's dragons are some of the best I've come across, from the varieties and their discerning qualities to their ability and willingness to bond to humans. Plus, the bond enables a psychic connection with their riders. These dragons are so well done. I applaud Rebecca Yarros for her imagination and vivid depictions in bringing them all to life.  The friends are an interesting variety as well. There are friendships that form almost instantly, those that have spanned entire lifetimes, those that form unexpectedly, and even ones that form begrudgingly. The personalities differ as much as the dragons and the abilities they bestow upon their riders. Violet's older sister, Mira, warns her against forming friendships in the rider's quadrant. Allies are important, but friendship can often be a liability. Plus, when cadets are dying more frequently than surviving, forming friendships means saying goodbye to people who have shared pieces of their hearts with you and vice versa. But Violet doesn't survive the rider's quadrant by following the path others have established. She must survive by her own instincts and her own journey through the tests and trials.  Speaking of abilities, Rebecca Yarros also did an excellent job creating a wide range of abilities since there are so many different characters. None of the signets were too similar to each other. And I loved the intrigue of wondering what new talent would be gifted to the next cadet. She even forms opposite sides of a coin without it appearing to be mirror talents.  The enemies were fierce. We start off with Violet being warned by her sister Mira to steer clear of Xaden Riorson because he will kill her as soon as he gets the chance as revenge for what her mother did to his father in executing the king's justice for his father's rebellion. Violet meets him almost immediately. Nearly the same time, a brutal new cadet sets his sights on her as an easy target to weed out the weak links. Only Violet embarrasses the new cadet, and he swears revenge that he will kill her. And he's not the only person she ticks off during her first year. Xaden is hard to read. He forces Violet into his wing since he's a wingleader. He bounces back and forth between giving her advice that will help her survive, ignoring her completely, and sending others to her in ways that could be construed either for or against her.  Of course, the driving questions are about whether Violet will survive each challenge she's faced with. If she does, will a dragon want to bond with her? At least until you get to a point where you have answers to these questions, and then you want to know what will happen next. I can't reveal those questions to you as they'd be spoilers.  Favorite quotes: -""They choose for reasons they don't see fit to share with us."" He pushes off his desk. ""And not all strength is physical, Violet.""  -You are not attracted to toxic men, I remind myself...  I had to laugh at that one.  -""One does not live a century without being well aware of the space one takes up.""  -""Justice is not always merciful.""  -""I know you just want to keep me safe,...,""I whisper. ""But keeping me safe is also keeping me from growing, too.""  -""I will hate you for this."" ""Yeah."" He nods, a flash of pure regret crossing his face as he draws away. ""I can live with that.""  -""Andarna is my favorite.""  -""You can ride me when the flesh rots off my bones, wingleader.""  -""Whatever you feel is natural. Allow yourself to feel it, but then let it go.""  -""...if we let fear kill whatever this is between us, then we don't deserve it.""  -""One generation to change the text. One generation to choose to teach that text. The next grows, and the lie becomes history.""  I was so disheartened when I finished Fourth Wing and went to go purchase Iron Flame only to find that it wasn't released yet. The unique school setting where the cadets die more often than survive. The friends. The enemies. The romance. The DRAGONS. All of it was exactly what I look for in a series. Now, I will say that once the characters leave the setting of the school and undoubtedly have to face the corrupt government, things have the potential to go south like series such as Divergent and The Hunger Games. We shall see if The Empyrean series can survive the traps that other series before it fell into or will it thrive similar to series like Red Rising and Throne of Glass. That being said, Fourth Wing gets 4.5 Stars. Have you read Fourth Wing? What did you think? Let me know!",4,Sandy Farmer,B0D923QDHR,2023-10-23
64,R13UJW2E1VACWT,Proven quality!!- Read my story??,"I bought this in Oct 2019. .....application was not as easy as other screen protectors I've used but it wasnt too bad.  The only thing I could complain is a little bit of a double-image type distraction near the edges that was noticeable when I play online games. I think it's the motion and graphics speed. Regular use of the phone to read or make calls, it's fine. Clear glass that wipes off nicely and doesnt actually smudge up too bad at all. The other day I dropped my Galaxy a10e from a store's checkout counter and it fell face first onto the polished concrete floor and I was scared to peek at the damage. Well, this protector did its job!! The corner chipped and there was quite a large ray of breaks across the top third of the screen protector.  I gently peeled up the left side and what did I see.....a pristine cellphone front glass????  The last thing I wanted to do was replace or repair this phone after just 10 months. I logged on to Amazon to purchase another protector just like what I had, found my previous order and see that this is a 2 pack.  I had forgotten! Well, YAYYY I went and found the packaging and warranty info from all of our electronics and sure enough, there was the second screen protector.  For this price, I am so pleased with the quality; it surely proved itself to me. I would have gladly paid this or a little more for just one of this quality! I'm very happy and we will will stick with this brand for further cell phone accessory needs.  The least I could do was come back on here and write a review since I hadnt before.... anyways, I recommend you look no further.....this is a great buy for a quality product.",5,Michelle G in Palm Bay FL,B0D5QNFDHZ,2020-08-28
65,R1EFWXZJMBOIF1,Excellent.,"I bought this for my mother in-law. I installed the first screen protector about a year ago and after a year and many many falls it finally broke in 4 places. This is my second time buying this screen protector because I lost the first set I had bought, but we don't need to talk about that. I love the fact that this one comes with two just in case something happens. It's easy to install and remove if it brakes. don't worry if after installing it you get a little hallo affect in some areas. It should disappear in a few days.  Over all not bad, not bad for the price. As long as they keep selling these, and my mother in-law keeps her phone witch should be for a few years I'll keep buying them.",5,Jesus Lopez,B0D5QNFDHZ,2020-07-21
66,R21IIIHNMAVSYR,"Worth the money, merchant upholds warranty","The product is worth the money. Comes with everything you need to install including the alignment frame which is very helpful. Overall, I’ve had a good experience with Ferilinso. I’ve needed to replace my screen twice due to them cracking while in use. Messaged Ferilinso via Amazon Message Center, and within a couple days I received confirmation that my replacement order was on the way.",5,Trevor S.,B0D5QNFDHZ,2019-11-14
67,R30TDFDAQ2I1G9,Great screen protector for the $,Idk why a lot of pol were giving these screen protectors bad reviews they are very durable & lol great & hold well once u fit it on your phone. The black outline blends perfectly with the black around my Galaxy a10e. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is cause it said it was bubble free & its not I still have a few small bubbles I couldn't get out once I secured it on.,4,BambiBrown87,B0D5QNFDHZ,2020-04-15
68,R2PR6G6204Q9E,Great quality,"Perfect fit for our phone.  This was actually our second time buying this.  The first one we bought many months ago for my teenager's phone had lasted a long time, but then cracked when something had hit it hard in an accident.  The phone still worked well even with the cracked protector.  We were able to remove the cracked protector with ease and were able to install this new one with no problem.  It works great and we have no complaints.",5,Kindle Customer,B0D5QNFDHZ,2020-09-11
69,R247G1FXO4ZT5K,Not my favorite screen protector,"This is not an exact fitted screen protector for the a10e. I'd pick another brand if buying again.  It has the cutout for the camera and the outside is lined with a black border. When it's applied to the screen you have to line it up perfectly or you can see the border -- there's no wiggle room. It sometimes covers text if you have it set to full screen.  It also leaves a significant gap between the edge of the protector and the edge of the phone. I have a phone case on and the gap catches crumbs and debris really badly.  Also, this does not come with installation guide stickers and is attached to an oversized white backing strip so you have to wing it when you apply the screen protector. Unlike other screen protectors where you can line it up before peeling off the backing.  Overall, it seems pretty sturdy and adhered well, but it's tricky to apply it precisely and that black border on the screen protector gets in the way sometimes.",3,Ashley C.,B0D5QNFDHZ,2019-08-22
70,R2XFWZXJDD4HSX,Favorite screen protector,I buy alot of screen savers for work units and i have to say this one is my favorite.  It has higher end packaging than most which seems to lessing the amount of static cling created when pealing off backing to apply to phone.  It also seems to be slightly thicker (no i have not measured it) glass. The only con is that bubbles trapped during application requires letting cover acclamate to the device for about 5 to 10 minutes and then try to remove. I find that over time all bubbles evetually go away with time to give that prefect everytime finish and look.,5,Amazon Customer,B0D5QNFDHZ,2019-10-18
71,R1RV6CNR06Y6A3,Worth the wait,"I was unhappy that it was late, but Amazon worked with me to fix that for me, so I'm grateful. I have really bad luck with my phones so I was worried that I'd break my new phone while waiting on my case and screen protector.  Thank God I didn't.  Once I received the product I applied it to my device and so far,  so good.  It's nice quality. Durable.  And sticks to my phone well.  And luckily it came with 2 so I have a replacement if and when I ever need one for this phone",5,Chellz,B0D5QNFDHZ,2019-09-28
72,R3WRQI7AH68X,Not worth the effort,"First the good, the cover window protector is adequate, the main screen protector is trash.  The main screen protector doesn't even have a notch cut out for the camera lens.  Heads up if you do buy the QR code in the box doesn't work for instructions.",2,Cotton,B0D5QNFDHZ,2024-07-24
73,RKEKYUKH8K4HT,“Bubble-Free” was a lie at first but it changed,"I had high hopes for this product. I give it 5 stars for the packaging. But on the front it clearly says “Bubble-Free” But when i cleaned the phone screen and put it on there, i spent  5 minutes trying to get these tiny bubbles out from underneath the screen. I rubbed my thumbs raw but there was still a bunch of of bubbles. ***BUT THEN THE BUBBLES DISSAPEARED AFTER A DAY OR SO. So i guess the screen protector wasnt ad bad as i thought.",4,Lindzee wallisa,B0D5QNFDHZ,2020-03-03
74,RINYSNHH5YUTX,Great device for making my new car now have wireless Apple Car Play,"I bought this for my 2018 Audi Q5 and was expecting that I'd probably have to return it as I didn't have high hopes. I was WRONG. I plugged it into my armrest USB port out of sight and it took a minute or so to set it up. It takes about 15 seconds or so to connect to your system when you turn the car on, which is fairly quick to me.  This item connects my car to its car play without me plugging in my phone every time I get in the car. I get in and out all day long so to have this saves me a lot of time!  Haven't had a problem with connection or sound. The connection has been fast and automatic. From Waze to Spotify it works like you have the phone connected. I would say that it works flawlessly about 95% of the time, as every so often there's a hiccup in the connection, but it's so infrequent I view it as a minor inconvenience.  The people who comment that it occasionally freezes up or reboots seem to forget that that happens sometimes even when your phone is plugged into the head using. I have not noticed it being any worse than plugging it in. I have had this for more than 1 month with several long and short trips—no complaints.  I've tried one other brand that didn't work, this one worked right out of the box. I verified that my vehicle matched the list of known working vehicles and it works flawlessly. Note that not all USB ports are CarPlay enabled, so make sure you plug it into the correct port. In my Audi both the visible and hidden USB ports are CarPlay compatible, so I love how the unit is hidden from view.  No issues so far and I love my purchase. It's a keeper!",5,helen,B0D9JMXV2B,2024-06-18
75,R14ER02B4UOCDL,No more wires No more headaches,"I was a little skeptical at first, but this was exactly what I needed. Toyota is pretty behind in not letting CarPlay via Bluetooth.  I'm a nut for taking care of my tech. Last year I was gifted an iPhone 13 Pro for my birthday, and it was a big upgrade for me. I don't like to keep my electronics plugged in once they reach 100% because it's not good for the battery health. I also don't like my phone being tethered in case someone needs to access my phone because I can't store it as easily. The cup holders in the Rav4 aren't that great.  I purchased this adapter and now I don't have to worry about any of that. Battery lasts me a long time. We went on a 10-hour road trip and I was playing Spotify, using Waze for directions, and my phone went from 100% to 40-50% during that whole time. I haven't had any issues and feel that it only takes 15 seconds for it to boot up on the infotainment. The infotainment can get laggy but it's more of Toyota's fault for using slower tech.  I always have my teen help with tech gadgets. This time I installed myself and it was easy to connect in seconds I was up and running in no time!!! The minute I got back to my car after being away for 4 hours… my Apple Music was jamming from my speakers without being inside the car. No stalling for connection to car play.  I highly recommend this small adapter if you want to have the freedom of your smartphone not being tethered all the time. This allows you to connect automatically with all of your features without needing to tie your phone up with cords. Overall I am quite happy with this purchase.",5,Rick Furr,B0D9JMXV2B,2024-06-14
76,R2N94O8Y4ZAOPA,I always loved CarPlay--- hard to beat Waze Maps and streaming and controlling Spotify,"Our 2022 RAV 4 is apparently the last model before Toyota introduced wireless CarPlay to their infotainment system. After doing some research on an aftermarket solution. I pulled the trigger on this CarPlay adapter.  This Wireless CarPlay Dongle is an incredibly convenient addition to your drive, allowing you to seamlessly connect any compatible device to apple carplay. With a single plug-in and play installation this dongle can quickly unlock all the benefits of apple carplay. We’ve been using it for three months and we’re very satisfied with this purchase.  There are a few things to be aware of: The unit is designed to reconnect to the last phone it was connected to. If only one person uses the car this is installed in, then it’s no problem. My wife and I share the car so we each have to connect to the CarPlay adapter via the Bluetooth menu on our phones when one of us starts up the vehicle. This process takes longer if one of the phones is running an older version of iOS. Not a deal breaker but something to be aware of. Occasionally, the unit doesn’t want to connect to a phone and we need to unplug it and plug it in again. But overall, this adapter has worked great and saved us the hassle of having yet another USB cable to deal with.  I am really enjoying CarPlay to the fullest. Go have one so your can experience easy access to all your music apps like Spotify as well as directions in maps for safe navigation at no additional cost. Enjoy a more connected driving experience with wireless technology today!",5,Abby Curchy,B0D9JMXV2B,2024-06-24
77,R3FLG96UUTDVIS,Exceeding expectations,"This CarPlay Adapter was able to connect the Apple CarPlay wireless in my car as advertised. No more cables or wire for Apple CarPlay. With so many other options available, we did research and found this the perfect for our car and the need. The wireless works seemingly and is great to use.  It's small so I can touch it into the back of the console. You would never know its there, and the bluetooth works great connects almost every time.  The Bluetooth connection between my phone and the adapter is almost instantaneous. Pretty short boot up time so there isn’t much delay in being able to use it. It’s been more than 3 months and I’ve found no lag between it and a hardwired connection.  Some other points worth mentioning: Setup - While this wasn’t a criteria I was tracking/comparing, it is also worth noting how incredibly simple setup was. Just a couple of steps over a couple of minutes and it was ready to go. Size - this thing is incredibly small. I thought it would be much bigger. I like how compact it is - easily stays out of the way.  I really enjoyed to have the music automatically connected to my phone/Spotify while starting the vehicle. If you are looking for a device to turn your Apple CarPlay from wire to wireless, this is exactly what you need. Extremely happy with Purchase.",5,Steven M Irwin,B0D9JMXV2B,2024-06-14
78,R3O8Y4NFCA097D,Very quick boot time for this Wireless CarPlay Adapter vs other units,"When the lightning connector on my iPhone died, I thought that I was not going to be able to use CarPlay on my 2022 Kia Telluride anymore (a feature that was, for me, a requirement in any vehicle we purchased going forward).  Thankfully, a coworker informed me that there were devices that could interface the USB connection to Wireless CarPlay.  After doing a little bit of research, it seemed that this device would be the best of the current lot available today. I'm sure devices from other manufacturers are fine, but I really liked the design aesthetics and simplicity of the device. It did not disappoint, either, because it's literally plug and play (Plug-and CarPlay!).  The other aspect that I liked about this device was that, unlike the others, this adapter's firmware can be updated. I haven't needed to do it, and I hope I don't have to do it, but it's nice to have the option to do it, if necessary (I believe they recommend a """"if it ain't broke, don't fix it"""" approach -- only update the firmware if you're having problems). I could only see this being a problem if Kia introduces a CarPlay update in the car and somehow alters the way it works. However, I'm hoping that will not be the case, and this adapter will just keep working, since it worked perfectly with our Telluride's CarPlay system out of the box.  Highly recommended.",5,Donnie Haese,B0D9JMXV2B,2024-06-22
79,R30Q0BKX1SPXNT,Not plugging in your phone every time you get in the car is great,"I love CarPlay--- hard to beat Waze Maps for traffic and police activity. Love streaming and controlling Spotify on the infotainment screen. I hated having to take my phone out and plug it into the head unit for all my short trips (about 90% of my driving) and seldom actually used CarPlay because of that. I found out about these devices on Youtube. There are several manufactures making these dongles. I picked this Wireless CarPlay because most of the reviews described it as having the fastest processor and boot time and least lag.  I've had this for about a month and I'm really happy with my purchase so far. I'd say the device works as advertised 98% of the time. Simply get in your car and carplay is connected within 15ish seconds. Once it's connected you are good to go until you turn the car off. I do a lot of traveling by car for work and this has been a god send. I don't really notice any lag on my Nissan infotainment.  Occasionally the device will get stuck at the boot screen and I will have to un-pair and re-pair my phone and then it works again no problem. This usually solves the majority of issues. Their technical support helped resolve this. I think it mainly has to do with usb ports getting power when the car is unlocked and the door is opened. If you are in and out of the car a few times without starting the car, it can confuse the device I guess. No big deal IMO, this will depend on the vehicle you drive. The only other thing I wish it had was a longer cable. For whatever reason it's pretty short and none of the other cables I've tried worked. Hopefully this is changed in a later revision or update.  I wasn't expecting much customer support when I purchased, but every time I had an issue or question I would hear back from someone within a day with troubleshooting steps/technical info/etc. I would definitely purchase again due to them standing behind their product and making sure customers are taken care of. I highly recommend this if you are looking for one of these devices.",5,Will Green,B0D9JMXV2B,2024-06-18
80,R23MS0320EJIVY,It's Literally Plug-and-CarPlay.,"I have two other CarPlay adapters for family members, and this unit seems to be the quickest to get up and running. Very straightforward setup in case someone doesn't read manuals etc.  Use the correct cable (standard USB and USB C included) and plug into your CarPlay-enabled USB port and power up the system, and look for a new Bluetooth device. Connect to the new device, it should start with AUTO-, and after a short wait, you will get the 'Set up new CarPlay Device"""" prompt on your phone.  I recommend getting a MagSafe phone/case charging MagSafe Compatible mount so you can just place the phone on the mount and start the car.  This unit is at least twice as fast getting CarPlay up on my car as older units, which is great if you are trying to get moving and GPS running on the screen quickly.  I need to do more testing on Screen Delay vs other units, but first impressions seem a little bit quicker. In one of my other units, the delay is pretty bad, so I end up hitting a button on the screen twice since I think the first touch didn't work.  I would recommend updating the firmware on your device after you receive it. You have two options - plugging into a PC or doing it via iPhone.

I can watch youtube, Netflix and I can control the volume using original car system without any issue. Sound and video quality is very good. Also I can download Netflix video which is very useful. I can download some Anime episode at home using our home Wifi, and bring them to our long drive.I just downloaded Crunchroll and Amazon Prime Video app as well.

83,R13U5K49GM7ZET,Carplay,"My experience with this seller was outstanding. I purchased a wireless ? CarPlay adapter and it worked great. Then when ? updated their iOS software, it started to become unreliable. OTTOCAST offered to send me a new one as well as pay postage for my returning the old one. Then they decided that a new one of the same model might have the same kind of problems, and I would have to go to the trouble of returning it. So they are sending me their latest CarPlay adapter, a faster and better model than the one I had. These people could not have been nicer. They really know what it means to stand behind their products and keep their customers happy.",5,AdrienneGeor,B0D9JMXV2B,2024-07-23
84,R2BBM1QJB7IFGG,CarPlay for not work… UPDATE****,For being advertised as CarPlay compatible it didn’t work. Very annoyed in general with my new iPhone 15 pro max haha I rebooted my system and had removed my phone from the Bluetooth making my phone set up as a new connection and all of a sudden my CarPlay works! It’s been three days of it working with no issues. So maybe it wasn’t this cable after all. 1 star is now 5 ??,5,Loops,B0D583XV3S,2024-07-15

I had been using a charging cable with a right-angle adapter, but that didn't fit with my new phone stands, so this 3.3 foot cable fits the bill. I'm getting the fast charging notification when plugged into the wall adapter.  It seemed odd to me that it was advertised only as a Carplay cable for iPhones. It's a standard USB-A to USB-C cable which is equally useful for newer Android phones, and that's what I needed. It might get more attention if that info was included in the description.",5,EC,B0D583XV3S,2024-06-23

116,R2AGRB6KPV0OOW,"Amazing, just amazing.","I LOVED THIS BOOK. The first one started a bit slow and like I said in my review, it was a bit repetitive, BUT man… this one was INCREDIBLE. I swear.  “A line that should never be crossed is about to be breached. It puts this entire castle in jeopardy—and the life of your friend.”  In this book we pick up right where we left off in Throne of Glass. Celaena has been named the King’s Champion and she now must fulfill his every wish. His every evil wish: kill this, kill that, and Celaena can’t do anything about it… or can’t she? She’s been told to do anything and everything in her power to uncover the King’s plans and the evil that surrounds her and everyone she cares about. Good think she’s smart.  This book was so, so, SO good. I absolutely loved it. The pace picked up a lot more than it did in the first book, so it was easier to get into the story. The character development was incredible. Every single character had me guessing what they were going to do next and sometimes they turned out to be completely different than I expected. Some others turned out to be exactly what I hoped they would be. The plot twists. OMG. I didn’t see some of them coming!!!!!!! So I was a bit shocked at first, but then realized how much sense they make to get the story going. And this world. Man, this world is just so freaking awesome. Every single detail is well-thought and they are so important to the story. I loved reading every single word of this book.  Celaena keeps being her sarcastic and badass self, but in this book you get to see her in her element. She fights like a true assassin, so she can be scary as hell sometimes, but the beauty of this character is that she’s the combination of a badass woman and sweet girl. She is able to recognize the good and the bad. She knows what side she’s on, even if it takes her a bit longer to come to terms with it. I think I understood her a lot more in this book. I also loved seeing her letting her guard down for a bit, and it felt completely different from what happened before. The stolen looks and stolen kisses. Meaningful words and memories. It felt deeper in this book. And I loved it, because she managed to show her vulnerable side without being weak. Not that I would think that she’s weak, of course.  “But he had no idea what sort of darkness lurked inside her, or what sort of monster she was willing to become in order to make things right.”  Now, let me tell you a little more about the mess this book has made out of me.  I’ve always talked about how strong I am when it comes to picking a boy in the books I read. It’s always easy. There’s always something to hate about one of the boys, making it easy for me to pick one and stay true to that one boy. But this? I knew this was going to be hard. I knew it the moment Dorian kissed her for the first time. I knew it the moment Chaol reacted out of passion and protectiveness. I knew it when I noticed both of these guy’s look towards Celaena. These two characters are beautiful and passionate and just so freaking lovable:  One is pure heart and magic. He’s just sweet and attentive and such beautiful and trusting soul. There’s magic within him. There’s power that he doesn’t know exists yet, but I know he’s destined for good. He is good in all the ways his father is bad.  “He would move on. Because he would not be like the ancient kings in the song and keep her for himself. She deserved a loyal, brave knight who saw her for what she was and did not fear her. And he deserved someone who would look at him like that, even if the love wouldn’t be the same, even if the girl wouldn’t be her.”  The other one is all about protecting those he care about, no matter the cost, all without exaggerating. He’s all about giving them the best of him, and making sure they are ok. He recognizes his mistakes for what they are and knows when to give some space. He’s passionate and trust-worthy. He’s reliable, even when he thinks he’s not.  “I worry because I care. Gods help me, I know I shouldn’t, but I do. So I will always tell you to be careful, because I will always care what happens.”  And I think, no I know, it will only get harder as the story goes on.  Now, the plot. OH MY GOD. There are a lot of things going on and you MUST pay attention to the details. They will show you the way to understand this amazing world and see it through the character’s eyes. Also, we have some shocking plot-twists that had me jumping up and down. Some I expected and some I didn’t, but that’s part of the beauty of this story.  I love all the possibilities this book has given me. There are queens and kings in the making. There is love that goes deep, but even so, it’s still fragile. There are truths, half truths and lies. There are mysterious and different kinds of magic.  I must thank you, Sarah J. Maas. You have created such a wonderful and magical place and characters. Each character and their story is interesting by itself, but as a whole, they manage to fit perfectly. This is definitely the kind of book that will keep you reading until there aren’t any more pages, and it will leave you wanting more.  So, do I recommend this series? So far, YESSSSSSSSS.",5,Daniela,B0D96RHR3Q,2016-07-25
117,R1F7ANQ5LHQEK3,"Beautifully-written, thrilling and mysterious...","I hereby declare CROWN OF MIDNIGHT by Sarah J. Maas the most worthy sequel of all sequels that have ever been written. Alright, perhaps I don't exactly have the authority to make such a declaration, but the beautifully-written, thrilling and mysterious sequel to the 2012 release, Throne of Glass, is more than deserving of the praise.  I read both Throne of Glass and CROWN OF MIDNIGHT in an (almost) marathon, with only one book in between. I cannot believe I waited so long to start this series! Now that I've read these first two books, I am already waiting with bated breath for the next installment. The wait each year, until the sixth and (at the time of this write-up) final book is released in 2017, will be pure torture, I tell you... Pure torture.  With that said, I guess you'd probably like to know why I love CROWN OF MIDNIGHT so much. I loved this second installment even more than I did the enthralling Throne of Glass, though that feat seemed near impossible at the time I was reading it. For anyone who enjoys good fiction - not just fantasy or magic or historical-type novels, but plain old good fiction - CROWN OF MIDNIGHT is a must-read. In this single novel you have the perfect combination of an original premise, a well-thought out cast of characters that you can root for as well as despise, a clash of kingdoms/enemies and allies, an unpredictable mystery, plenty of romance, action and adventure and so much more. If I had to make a comparison, after reading just the first two installments I can already see the Throne of Glass series doing for young adults (and adults) what Harry Potter did for kids (and adults) in the last two decades.  What did I like most about CROWN OF MIDNIGHT? I'd say the writing, since the book is full of so many quotable passages and is highly ""readable"" for any lover of fiction. The descriptions the author uses to develop her world, her mythology and a history of magic are far more convincing than anything else I have read in fantasy fiction lately. Her dialogue conveys the character's personalities and emotions, while allowing the readers to fill in the blanks and develop our own opinions about their motives. The fact that the author excels in her writing style and skills is undeniable, but that is not the only reason I loved this novel...  I also loved how solid every single element of the story feels. CROWN OF MIDNIGHT takes the introductions to both the characters and the world from book one and progresses those items into a solid story that, albeit fantastical, we as readers can 100% believe in. Actions and reactions roll off on each other like the swell of waves on steady seas. As with any ocean, those waves must come crashing into the shore at some point. In CROWN OF MIDNIGHT that crash comes with such force, at a point when the reader is most invested in the story, that it feels like the waves are crashing against our own heart. Because the author has created such a solid story, cast and world, both the good and the terrible things that happen within these pages are felt and believed in with every fiber of the reader's being. But that's not all...  I'm always pleased when we get to see a romance progress before the final installment. I also love it when enough time has passed that the romance progresses in a realistic way, rife with uncertainty, passion and discovery. The ""love triangle"" that appeared in book one is quickly resolved in CROWN OF MIDNIGHT. But that is not to say that things are all unicorns and glitter for our pair of lovers... This book contains plenty of romantic swoons, I can't deny that. But we must keep in mind that we're talking about a romance involving a hired assassin for a tyrannical king, so things can (and will) go wrong for anyone who hopes for happiness... I love (LOVE) that the romance in this book feels just as solid as every other element of the story, despite its ups and downs.  Can I just talk about the characters for a moment? There are so many within these pages, both old and new. In Throne of Glass I came to like the four main characters, Celaena, Chaol, Dorian and Nehelemia, as I gradually got to know them. While reading CROWN OF MIDNIGHT, my love for (and connection to) the characters just exploded! Trust me when I say that Throne of Glass was a mere build-up to the direction in which each of their lives were taken in book two. CROWN OF MIDNIGHT trumps all. Hands down.  We see so much more assassin ""bad-assery"" out of Celaena in CROWN OF MIDNIGHT. (In Throne of Glass, I just wasn't convinced. But now.... NOW I AM.) This girl kicks some serious bad guy butt, guys. Celaena balances the fine line between good and evil with finesse, but all the while I love where her heart is in every move she makes. I never thought that I would back a killer as much as I do the young and extremely dangerous Celaena, but there you have it: I totally support every kill she makes and would totally take her on as my own personal Champion.  I wish I could go on and on about my love for CROWN OF MIDNIGHT, but since it is full to the brim with surprises and new developments, to say more would be to spoil the story for you.  If you have not yet read the first book, Throne of Glass, you really need to get on that ASAP. For those who are eagerly awaiting this installment, trust me, the wait is worth it. Be glad you have yet to experience the awesomeness that is CROWN OF MIDNIGHT. I'm sad that I will never again have a ""first read"" of it, but then again... I guess there will be at least four more ""first reads"" in this series, won't there?  Can. Not. Wait.  My favorite passage from CROWN OF MIDNIGHT:    ""Enough! We have enough enemies as it is! There are worse things out there to face!""    Celaena slowly turned to him, her face splattered with blood and eyes blazing bright. ""No there aren't,"" she said. ""Because I'm here now.""",5,Jenna Detrapani,B0D96RHR3Q,2013-09-24
118,RCQ7GKN327XQC,4 Stars,"Crown of Midnight started off with Celaena being a bit more active in the king's service. Where she finally won the title of King's Champion in Throne of Glass, the King is finally calling her into service to dispatch his enemies. And even though she's an assassin in deed, Calaena finds herself in a tough position. The King threatened Chaol and Nehemia and their families if Calaena doesn't perform up to his standards, but she knows that he is an evil man and will likely use her to simply further his world domination attempts rather than for justice. She has to fight back how she can, but it takes being extremely careful in how she chooses to do so. This means that her friends also aren't in the know because that puts them in danger as well.  Crown of Midnight felt a bit longer to me than Throne of Glass even though it's not really longer, and it didn't even take me but 3 days more to read. I think I felt that way because events were bee-bopping along and I was loving the direction that things were going until about 45% I realized that things were going too well too quickly. And then panic mode set in. I knew that something had to happen to disrupt all of the good things going on with the characters. And for the 2nd time in this series I wanted to seek out spoilers just so that I could prepare myself and not be so worried or stressed out about what was about to happen to these loved characters. I didn't. I did text my feelings to Holly. Thank goodness I could bounce my fears off her and know that she wouldn't spoil anything for me. But this fear actually had me putting Crown of Midnight down more often because I was trying to put off the terrible events I could feel coming for as long as possible.  And of course, I was correct. Things were going too well for these characters. Calaena suffers a major blow which causes a bit of an emotional break. She's been through a lot in her 18 years, and she's suffered and lost so much during that time. I can understand her grief in some ways, but who and how she chooses to lash out to didn't make complete sense to me. Yet, I can see how her actions and reactions were necessary to further the story and plot and her character in general.  All of the characters that I fell in love with in book 1 were just as loveable in Crown of Midnight. Nehemia is Calaena's best friend. She's a princess whose land the King is currently conquering. And she's desperate to do anything she can to get her people freed and not just her people, but all of those who are under the thumb of the King. She isn't afraid to say the hard things that needs to be said to Calaena. That's the proof of a true best friend. You might not always like what they have to say, but it is always for your good to hear it. Hugs and a salute to Nehemia.  Dorian took a step back from his relationship with Calaena. It wasn't entirely his doing, but he was gracious about it. Although, Crown of Midnight indicates that Dorian knew how Chaol felt about Calaena going all the way back to the Yulemas ball in Throne of Glass so one has to wonder why he chose to pursue her in the first place. However, I really came to respect Dorian. Not only in his graciousness, but also in his ability to be there for Calaena when she needed him and could go to no one else. He didn't have to be there for her. He could have behaved much differently towards her. But that's not who he is. Plus he has his own catalyst that will propel him into rebelling against his father that is entirely different than Calaena's. I look forward to seeing him become more of the man I believe he can be in future books.  Chaol was my man from the very beginning of Throne of Glass. He battles his position in being Captain of the Guard and what that means for his loyalty to the King with his friendships with Dorian, Nehemia, and his growing feelings for Calaena. His choices while not wrong do cause some negative consequences for him that he'll be regretting for some time to come. I felt so bad for him through the later half of the book. Yet he's still my favorite.  The villains are present as well. We know that the King is at this point the ultimate villain, but he wasn't even that active or present in the story of Crown of Midnight itself. I know he'll take on a larger role as the series continues. I don't feel like I can discuss the true villain of this book without spoilers so I'll keep that out of this review. Duke Perrington was mentioned but took an even smaller role than the king. Katlain which we loved to hate from book 1 had a small part. Mostly she's just pitiful now. And there's a new character on the scene, Roland Havilliard. I don't trust him. On the one hand, he seemed in league with the King and Duke Perrington, but on the other he seemed to be a pawn in their games/plans.  Favorite quotes: -&#34;You will never forget killing Cain,&#34; she said at last, and when her eyes met his, his heart pounded so hard he could feel it across his whole body. &#34;But I will never forget what you did to save me, either.&#34;  -&#34;If she picked Roland over you, that makes her the greatest fool who ever lived.&#34;  -...it was the knight's gift, of seeing her for who she was--not what she was--that won her heart.  -But death was her curse and her gift, and death had been her good friend these long, long years.  -Then Calaena and the King of Adarlan smiled at each other, and it was the most terrifying thing Dorian had ever seen.  I do think that Crown of Midnight was intended to end in a little bit of a cliffhanger. Not in the way of withholding information from the reader, but more in the way of giving the reader some important information right before ending and not being able to see what the characters will do with that information. I wasn't particularly surprised by the revelation. The only big surprise for me happened about halfway through the book.  This book gripped me. I was so emotionally invested in what happened and was going to happen to these characters that I've come to love. It just doesn't get much better than that. Crown of Midnight was packed with happy moments that had me cheesing. But it is also packed with heart wrenching and stressful moments. There's action and mystery as well. Crown of Midnight gets 4 Stars from me. I can't wait to dive into Heir of Fire. Have you read Crown of Midnight? What did you think? Let me know!",4,Sandy Farmer,B0D96RHR3Q,2017-01-23
119,R3GMPF3T5AJT7Q,Surpasses Throne of Glass by FAR,"*flails* This book was so good. I liked Throne of Glass, but I LOVED Crown of Midnight. (!!!) Watch out below for some spoilers if you haven't read Throne of Glass yet.  Ten Likes/Dislikes:  1. (+) Celaena, the protagonist - Celaena and I haven't had the best of pasts. When I first read Throne of Glass, I thought she was too arrogant - so arrogant that I found it hard to identify with her, so arrogant that I never really believed in the danger that she faced. My wishes were granted, though: you do find out more of Celaena's past, and you do get more into her head in Crown of Midnight. She's still bold and brash, clever and witty, strong and assertive, and yes, quite able to defend herself (and thus proves herself as an assassin and King's Champion)--but where she shines in this novel, it's none of those things. It's when she finally shows some vulnerability, some doubt, some emotion, and that actually made me want to hug her. That got me rooting so much for her that it was nearly inconceivable that I didn't like her before. So if you loved Celaena in Throne of Glass, you will ache for her in this novel. If you weren't her greatest fan in Throne of Glass, maybe you'll like her in Crown of Midnight.  2. (+) World-building - You wanted more on Adarlan and life outside the court and in Rifthold? How about the political system? How about the magic and the King's nefarious plots? How about Elena's history and the beasts we found in Throne of Glass? There's that and much, much more. One of my favorite things about the Throne of Glass series is that there's so much to be discovered in the world, little details about the food and city that give it a different feel besides the usual medieval aspects of high fantasy. These are the kind of details that you can feel and appreciate as a reader but don't have to analyze (though Shannon does quite well in the linked blog post). Yeah, there are some epic fantasy cliches, but they never feel old and too much. Ms. Maas does a great job reinventing old tropes into her own world.  3. (+) Romance - Undoubtedly, the romance will anger some fans as Celaena makes a clear decision in this novel but isn't too tactful about that decision. Personally, I wasn't a huge fan of the non-interest (not just romantic-wise but also character-wise), so while I recognized that Celaena and Chosen One could have done better, I still reveled in the slow-burn that soon came to pass. Most of all, I was just happy that there wasn't the same level of love triangle as in the first book. Both Dorian and Chaol spend some parts in the beginning fantasizing or moping about Celaena but not for too long. And the best part of it is that the romance is one of a few things that forces development of these three characters and fits unexpectedly into the plot. This novel is a much darker, more mature novel than its predecessor, so if you were concerned about that in Throne of Glass, take this as a warning for Crown of Midnight, though I personally think that Ms. Maas was tasteful about both the action and the romance scenes.  4. (+) Plot - Ooh, wow. All the different plot threads of this beauty. The plot improved greatly from the Competition in the former book. There's still the loose threads introduced by the creatures Celaena previously encountered, the romantic threads, the threads of Celaena's past, Celaena as King's Champion, the King's plans and other events that are set into motion by all of the above. So much is happening in this novel, and all the threads come together beautifully. Some of the twists are a bit more predictable than others, but their predictability didn't take away any enjoyment (for me).  5. (+) Character Cast - Nehemia's friendship with Celaena is one of my favorite female friendships in YA. I especially love that it's made clear that Nehemia has her own motivations, her own set of beliefs--a past and a personality before she meets Celaena. Other side characters from Throne of Glass who I didn't expect to be reintroduced are brought back to reinvigorate the plot in unexpected ways.  Some new characters are introduced, though am I allowed to consider a talking doorknob a character?  6. (+/-) Incorporation of Previous Work - Have you read the Throne of Glass prequel novellas? (Side note: they are being bound and made into a print book, if you're interested). If you haven't read them, there are some mentions in this novel that might confuse you (especially novella #2, in the desert). On principle, I dislike the feeling of inside jokes (from the novellas) that you won't understand as a regular reader and figured I ought to warn others of this, though I did think that Ms. Maas had a sneaky and cool way of incorporating the novellas and Throne of Glass (not just the events and relationships and plot details but other details I hadn't remembered until they came up again).  7. (+/-) Themes - I think this is a book that will make some fans cry and rage with its careful exploration of the domino effect of choices and manipulation. The themes of love and loss also come into play a lot more fully in this novel than they did in Throne of Glass. That being said, there was one event in particular that I personally didn't think sent the best of messages, though I'm still not sure what else could have happened to have had as propulsive of an effect on character development.  8. (+) Writing - The writing reminds me of that in Angelfall - not because they're from the same type of POV (they're not), but because they have a similar, cinematic effect that allows me, a non-visual reader, to picture clearly what is happening. There are a few fully-fledged narrative scenes and dream sequences, but overall they were so minor in light of the entire plot that I thought they actually sometimes helped.  9. (+) Pacing - This book starts with action and ends with a bang. There's really no dull moment or unused scene. A lot of things contribute double time towards building the tension for the climax.  10. (+) The Cover - I'm actually a fan of the new covers, though the pose for this one is quite awkward. On the flip side, you have Celaena in a dress, so you get both sides of her and the dramatic fiery colors work well for the book's content.  All in all, Crown of Midnight does exactly what a sequel should do: advances the plot while developing the characters, world, and themes and maintaining high stakes. If you are a fan of Throne of Glass, you simply cannot miss out on Celaena's latest adventure. Highly recommended.",5,Christina,B0D96RHR3Q,2013-08-27
120,R3KR5F0QTSAUJM,A great second book,"I’m not sure where to start with this one. I tend to write shorter reviews as a series progresses, unless a book shocks and/or greatly disappoints.  This is the second book in the TOG series, and I am a prisoner of this story. I’m so invested! It’s taking every bit of power (which I DO NOT have) to pick up any other book. I was able to squeeze a Mitch Albom book in between the first and the second, but I’ve no clue how successful I’ll be in my future attempts. I’ve already started reading the third!  In this second book, the plot expands but not as significantly as I would have wanted. It picks up immediately where its predecessor left off. The series of events thereafter are fun, fast-paced, and keep you wanting more. Rather than learn more about its world, this book focuses more on some of its history to tries and help us understand why things are happening. SJM still does an excellent job at making sure we’re well engaged and has shown, time and time again, that no one is safe. &lt;i> SJM is a secret murderer. No one can convince me otherwise. You fiend! &lt;/i> C remains one of the most fun characters I’ve ever read, and I value her dynamic personality. So scary but so lovable. So prone to getting hurt and she does…repeatedly. &lt;i> Give the woman a break! &lt;/i> I learned to love Chaol in this book and was devastated, in the end, when everything unfolded. Dorian…eh. I like him less and less. Dunno why. One place where I feel SJM can do a little better is in creating stronger connections. Despite hating some of the things that happened, I did not feel that C’s reaction was warranted. I think that’s due to there not being enough material for us to feel as intently as C does about other people. I’m more invested in C than anyone else. I’m not even afraid of this terrible, scary king…  I did love learning a lot more about the history of Erilea and am even more excited about the next book. Adarlan almost feels like a rat-infected sewage of awful people and I need things to move away for a bit. &lt;i> Or forever. &lt;/i>  I must commend SJM for her writing style. Some fantasy books spend so much time building a world and the story sometimes gets lost in all this. I enjoy that she does world-building but keeps the story moving. It helps that her writing is very good.  I love this book, but I can’t lie and say that I didn’t see the big reveal coming. I didn’t connect some of the dots, but the *gasp* wasn’t there. It also made me a little angry at C. I get the fear and understand some of the reasons she’d shy away from some things, but ***’s death was hardly the trigger she needed. I would have figured 500 dead rebels or two whole slave camps would have done it, but alas.  I’m looking forward to the next book and can’t wait to see where this goes.",5,Willian,B0D96RHR3Q,2024-02-20
121,R2HBGREXTUNSU,"Despite a few disgruntled readers, my 10 year old & I love the series!!!","Okay, truth...my daughter is 10 and in the 5th grade. Grandpa, an avid reader like myself, went out on a limb and bought the book for her last Easter. We struggle to find books that are in her 8.4-9.5 reading level, have age appropriate content with a plot she has the life experiences to connect to and comprehend, that are also challenging AND interest her...tall order. We have read all the popular series - adore Harry Potter, of course; tore through the &#34;Greggor the Overlander&#34; series, etc. - so even though in previewing  the series I noticed it contains some very minor-vanilla...no F-bombs or S$$T level, mature-type language, and there are a couple scenes that hint at an intimate relationship in book 2 (trying not to spoil books), I gave the book a green light. We started reading it together, taking turns reading aloud, and were BOTH immediately, read 30-40 pages at a time, wake up needing to see what happens to Celena, come home from school hoping to fit in a read and &#34;see what Celena has gotten up to now&#34; before dance, hooked like I have never seen her before!!! And while she is an awesome reader, she is not, by any means a sit & read person, preferring to dance, sing, socialize, game, etc...yet another challenge to add to the list. The challenged are important to note because the way Maas has crafted the characters has achieved what NO OTHER series has for my daughter, and that is to draw her in to the point she NEEDS to keep reading, every single day. The characters are beautifully developed to the point where my daughter was crying when she thought her favorite character died, and was angry at who did die. Maas has painstaking developed 3-dimensional characters that are ever evolving, and that are relatable to all ages. She has also created an entirely new setting that is similar enough to other books of the same genre, like Hunger Games (she has read/watched all), yet it is entirely new & fresh. The writing is clear & thought-provoking, and she weaves in asides & flashbacks that challenge and engage readers. We have had the most incredible conversations and my daughter has made multiple connections to other texts, movies, life, and especially music/song lyrics while reading. These connections are the reason I personally & professionally recommend  the series to children beginning at age 10 who are reading at a 6.5-7+ grade level, primarily due to the challenging vocabulary. The twists and turns, the co afflicts & themes, character interactions, vivid & selected detailing, and obviously careful/thoughtful word choices make this series, in my opinion, an award winning, best selling series. As a reading specialist and 18 year veteran teacher of struggling readers, I fully give not just this book, but the entire series 5 stars! I could rave on and on...but I don't want to give away a single detail and only, sincerely hope what I have shared has piqued your curiosity enough to give the series a try yourself, along with a loved one, and that through sharing our personal experiences with the books I have helped answer the question of reader age appropriateness & interest level. Buckle up...it's a wild, wonderful ride through Adarlan! Added info for Book 2... Please note: I am reading the series aloud with my daughter, so as we go we just naturally, out of habit, change cuss words to &#34;gosh&#34; and &#34;darn.,&#34; and the intimacy scenes were handled as follows: &#34;A., this next chapter has Choal and Celeana interacting like a married couple sometimes do in private. Shall we read or skip?&#34; Reply, &#34;Well, um is it very like detailed?&#34; Me: &#34;Nah, it's pretty vague.&#34; A: &#34;Well, I know she shouldn't be doing that stuff because they are not married, but let's just read it...it's not like I'm embarrassed or going to act like that myself...ewwww!&#34; (Love the sweetness this age!) Basically, here is my point and yes I have one... if you take the time to first, preview what you will read with your child later; second, spend the time to read aloud with your child; third, talk to your child & maintain open dialogue, all the time, about everything, just as though they are the adults-in-training they really are (not saying talk like you are buddies, peers, or equals), the content of a fictional novel is not going to become controversial or be outrageous to them, throwing them into a tizzy of misadventure and exploits! So yes, while, the series is for ages 14+, I still maintain that WITH parental supervision/accompaniment, this is an incredible series to read together!",5,KPoulin,B0D96RHR3Q,2017-08-26
122,RXBRONZKER6VH,SO much better than the first book,"After THRONE OF GLASS I wasn't expecting great things from this book, but Maas has provided me with an incredibly pleasant surprise.  I rate the first one at about 3 stars, and despite it being a light, fun read I was significantly disappointed with the characters and several important aspects of the writing and structure.  Most of those things were largely re-modelled and repaired for this book, and I found myself enjoying it much more from the very beginning.  From the first page Celaena is morally conflicted about her assassinations, and shows consideration of deeper ethical issues. She actually develops and grows throughout the novel! Who'd have thought?  Saying this, the introductory section of the story, in which plot and characters are established, did stretch out for a full half of the book.  About 40% of the way through I seriously thought I'd let myself become hopeful too soon, and was just in for another complete book of the same fluffy dancing around important issues the first one consisted of.  But then about halfway through, the story takes off, and it doesn't stop.  Here, we see Celeana in the role that's always been rumoured but never witnessed before now. Adarlan's Assassin. We see her let loose and fight and kill.  She is brutal and savage and gruesome and it is fantastic.  She is dark and wicked and I loved her for it so much more than I ever loved her flirty or pretty.  It frustrated me when someone was trying to bring her back from the madness; talk her out of the darkness, because in the darkness she was amazing.  My respect for her instantly shot up at seeing her cause ruthless carnage (disturbing as that sounds), because this is the character we were promised back on the blurb of book one; this is the character we wanted to read.  Finally, she emerges.  And perhaps because it was so overdue, it was ridiculously satisfying.  There was not quite so much obsession over the love triangle in this book either, which impressed me significantly.  Romance was a large focus in the first half of the book, but only because it was used as a driving force for the plot events that occurred in the second half of the story, at which stage romance retreated to the periphery and yielded to action.  I was glad that unlike the first book, where it was essentially used as the main plot-draw for readers, the romantic aspect was used instead to support and enhance the plot.  It made for a much more readable story.  Additionally, there's also a lot more in this book on Celaena's personal background and the history of the world, which is all well presented.  The core plotline that one can sense will be the focus of the series entire is further developed, but not so much as to leave nothing for the next books to cover.  In fact, I would say the central plot is only just beginning.  My one concern in this regard, is that Maas revealed everything about Celaena's history all at once.  It made for a great ending and a stunning developmental twist to her character, which would have been perfect leading into the final book of a trilogy, but considering there are supposedly another four books or something to come, I am a little concerned about where she'll go with the character from here.  As mentioned I didn't much like Celaena in book 1 due to her lack of depth and development, and I'm worried that now Maas has unleashed all the development and revelations at once, and Celaena will slide back into being flat and emotionally stagnant for the rest of the series.  But I suppose that's why she's the author, and as a reader I can't but trust in her abilities to continue keeping me amazed, surprised and entertained.  I have settled on awaiting the next instalment with cautious anticipation, and will conclude here by saying that even those who thought the first book was `okay' like I did, should enjoy this sequel much more. If this is you, don't decide whether or not to read this based on the first book.  Although it starts off similar it is worlds better, and I strongly believe you will enjoy it much more.",4,La|U|Ra,B0D96RHR3Q,2013-08-18
123,R269SEZYXMAP6L,good quality,"This is a high-quality tempered glass screen protector for my Samsun Galaxy S22 Ultra. The clarity of the tempered glass is exceptional. It provides a crystal-clear view of my phone's display without any distortion or loss of brightness. This is crucial for a device like the Galaxy S22 Ultra, which has such a vibrant and detailed screen. The protector is so clear that it feels like there's nothing on the screen at all, allowing me to enjoy my phone's display to the fullest.  One of the standout features of this screen protector is that it does not affect the touch screen sensitivity. Every swipe, tap, and gesture is registered just as accurately and quickly as it was without the protector. This seamless interaction is vital for maintaining the phone's usability and ensuring a smooth user experience.  Installation was a breeze. The package included all the necessary tools, such as cleaning wipes and a dust removal sticker, to ensure a dust-free and bubble-free application. Following the step-by-step instructions, I was able to install the protector perfectly on the first try. There were no air bubbles or misalignments, and it adhered firmly to the screen.  Another important aspect is how well the fingerprint reader works with the screen protector. I was initially concerned that the added layer might interfere with the fingerprint sensor, but those worries were unfounded. The fingerprint reader works flawlessly, recognizing my prints quickly and accurately every time. This was a huge relief, as I rely on the fingerprint sensor for quick and secure access to my phone.",5,WinWin,B0D96RHR3Q,2024-06-15

222,R1SOA04H24RPUK,Sonic the Hedgehog - A Blast of Nostalgia and Adventure,"As a child of the '90s, I grew up with the iconic video game character Sonic the Hedgehog. So, when I heard that a live-action movie was being made, my inner child couldn't help but jump with excitement. I walked into the theater with a mix of anticipation and a touch of nostalgia, hoping that the film would capture the essence of the beloved blue speedster. And let me tell you, Sonic the Hedgehog did not disappoint.  From the moment the movie started, I was transported back to my childhood, the world of Sega Genesis, and countless hours spent guiding Sonic through vibrant, fast-paced levels. The film beautifully blends the animated world with live-action, seamlessly bringing Sonic and his iconic friends to life. Sonic himself is an absolute delight. His energy, wit, and mischievous personality are perfectly captured, and I found myself cheering for him as he raced across the screen.  What impressed me the most was the attention to detail and the respect for the source material. The film cleverly weaves in references and Easter eggs for the die-hard Sonic fans, like myself. From the iconic golden rings to the sound effects of collecting rings and even the way Sonic curls into a ball during his signature spin attack, every element was meticulously crafted to make fans feel right at home. I couldn't help but smile every time I caught one of these nostalgic nods.  But Sonic the Hedgehog isn't just about nostalgia; it also delivers an engaging and heartwarming story. The film centers around Sonic's journey to protect his newfound friends and find a sense of belonging in a world that is new and strange to him. The character development is surprisingly deep, and I found myself emotionally invested in Sonic's quest to find his place in the world. The dynamic between Sonic and the bumbling but endearing Tom, played by James Marsden, adds an extra layer of humor and heart to the story.  Jim Carrey's portrayal of the iconic villain, Dr. Robotnik, is an absolute scene-stealer. Carrey's over-the-top energy and comedic timing bring the character to life in the most delightful and hilarious way possible. He perfectly captures the essence of the mad scientist, making him a formidable yet entertaining adversary for Sonic.  Sonic the Hedgehog is a rollercoaster ride of action, adventure, and heartfelt moments that will resonate with both fans of the video game franchise and newcomers alike. It captures the spirit and charm of Sonic in a way that is relatable and accessible, making it a fun experience for audiences of all ages. This movie reminded me why I fell in love with Sonic as a kid and reignited my passion for this beloved character.  So, whether you're a die-hard Sonic fan or just looking for an entertaining and nostalgic ride, I wholeheartedly recommend Sonic the Hedgehog. Grab some popcorn, fasten your seatbelt, and get ready to speed through a world of adventure with the fastest hedgehog around. You won't be disappointed!",5,Shatoni Marie,B0D8HMMSS6,2023-07-05

224,R3QLYX0E0X66VU,"Finally, they've got it right.","Look I know it goes without saying since its long become a trope with Hollywood failing to bring a video game property to the silver screen. Gaming has been around for decades and has become such a huge facet of the entertainment industries that you would think somebody would have hit long before. The Resident Evil series has been the closest they've ever come before in an adaptation and even then there were liberties taken with the source material as is done in most cases when the corporate machine gets their hands in on it, but for some reason Sonic was able to run past all of this kind of meddling and into theaters in a way that does so much justice to gaming in just this one movie.  For starters they listened to the backlash. When the first Sonic model was revealed it was a horrid mess, and a reworking fashioned the character much more like the game and imaginations of gamers everywhere could imagine him. Some would argue pandering to fans a bad thing but at the end of the day when it comes to movies with gaming as its core source to alienate them is to risk having your work fail at the box office and ruin your chances of any kind of profit. The end result is a much better looking character model and fan support.  The story isn't an all-too original one, either. Alien from outside earth comes to planet seeking to be accepted, and man seeking an elusive ideal doesn't realize he had it all along to begin with. But the combination of both plot lines and addition of gaming elements (the rings, Robotnik, and the cameo of Tails at the end) creates somehow a fresh look at both. There is just enough callbacks and easter eggs referencing the Sonic game series to be nostalgia tasting without overdoing it to the point of annoyance. Heck, even the recurring joke about Olive Garden serves not just as a product placement but an easter eggs itself ""When You're Here, You're Family,"" which I take as being about the movie's meaning.  Funny how a game series that at least for most of its titles were sidescrolling platform games with barely a whiff of plot (as most platformers were back in those days) was able to capture audiences through a movie experience (and sequel, too) where so many plot-driven titles have failed in the past. It seemed a real passion for the source material could be felt which must have resonated by many of those who worked on it. Even Jim Carrey--the perfect actor for Robotnik--was motivated to star in this because of his daughter's love of the games in her youth.  Great movie, fun, engaging, familiar, and heartwarming and campy--just what movies need to be sometimes without much exposition and elements of messaging which seem to hard to find these days. Great for kids and adults.  Bonus (and spoilers):  On my recent watch It dawned on me that in the final battle with Robotnik in Green Hill Sonic had to bounce against the chassis of Eggman's ship multiple times before it finally went down, which to me was done specifically to echo the repeated hits you needed to make on boss battles in the game. Another example of the filmmakers effort to try to bring elements from the source to the screen and did so awesomely.",5,Joshua A. Cunningham,B0D8HMMSS6,2022-05-01
225,R2337AQWJF7CX5,"The best video game movie, but it's not quite high praise.","As many of you recall, Paramount released their first trailer for the new Sonic film early last year. Many of its fans were freaked out by the redesign of the title character, especially in regard to the smaller eyes and human teeth. The backlash was not entirely unexpected; Paramount had figured that fans would have objections, but that the general public wouldn’t mind (as was the case with the Michael Bay TMNT films). The idea was that this new design would blend in better with the real-world atmosphere than a more cartoony look.  However, the redesign caught the attention of the media, and at this point, Paramount made an usual decision: they were going to delay the release by several months, just to redesign Sonic. This was especially unusual as the general thought was that the film was going to suck anyway, and wasn’t worth the effort. After I saw the trailer, I thought that it was a fool's errand, noting that it seemed to be a waste of money for what looked like a generic kids film.  My History With Sonic  Growing up, I never really got into the Sonic The Hedgehog games. Ours was a Nintendo household, so my only exposure was playing Sega games at a friend’s house. When I played the games years later via emulator, I didn’t really enjoy them. They seemed to offer style over substance with little challenge, whereas Mario games had actual difficulty and innovation.  Where Sonic had the edge was in television. The various Super Mario animated shows were all terrible, filled with lame pop culture references (“May the pasta be with you!”)and your usual children’s show cliches. Conversely, the two Sonic shows seems to have a much better plot, in particular the Saturday Morning show (“He’s the fastest thing ALIVE!”).  I was never planning to see this in theaters, as video game movies are almost invariably awful. The film looked like a trainwreck with or without the redesign, and it was aimed at kids anyway. However, sitting bored at home one quarantined afternoon, I decided on a whim to see what the rental price was on Prime Video. Turned out it was free for me; I had a $5.99 Prime Video credit due to some late deliveries, so I figured I’d check it out.  The Film  The movie starts in medias res with Sonic being chased through a city by Dr. Robotnik, before pausing on a freeze-frame. Yep, we’re doing the ‘How we got here” cliche.  It then flashes back to several years prior, where Sonic grows up on some unnamed planet that matches the Green Hill Zone from the games. Sonic is raised by some owl who is described as being like Obi-Wan Kenobi. However, we never have time to see why, as the film rushes through this opening. Yep, this was just shot for the trailers. Sonic and the owl are attached by the Echidna tribe, and the owl saves Sonic by tossing him in a ring portal, warping him to Earth.  Sonic grows up in the wilderness of Green Hills, Montana, a quiet little town. He was warned to lay low, but uses his super speed to survive, living off-the-grid in a secret cave. He secretly observes the lives of Tom and Maddie Wachowski, the local sheriff and veterinarian, wanting to be their friend. In frustration at being alone, Sonic’s super speed causes an EMP. This gains the attention of the Pentagon and their scientific advisor, Dr. Robotnik. Tom finds Sonic hiding in his shed, and after some misunderstandings agrees to help Sonic get to San Francisco to retrieve his rings. And the rest of the film is a road trip adventure to achieve that goal. Will Sonic make it, and will he and Tom learn the power of true friendship™?  Like I mentioned, this film really wasn’t aimed at me. If it had come out in the 90’s, I would have certainly seen this, though perhaps the CGI wouldn’t have been possible at the time. The film certainly isn’t a trainwreck, but it is your cliched kids movie. Most of the adult actors are clearly phoning it in, and the theme of wanting to make friends is a little too juvenile for this film.  The plot is rather thin, and considering that the film clocks in at a brisk 90 minutes, one gets the impression that some of the backstory was edited out. Tom wants to leave Green Hills to become a San Francisco cop, yet at the end of the film decides not to, with little explanation. Dr. Robotnik is also unexplored. You get the idea that he became a misanthrope after being bullied as a kid, but most bullying victims don’t become supervillains. Having said that, Ben Schwartz is great as Sonic, employing the cockiness and devil-may-care attitude of the games. I was expecting to hate Jim Carrey in this film, but he pulled off enough funny scenes and lines to remind us of his 90’s self.  The film does have some cool super-speed moments. Sure, they do rip off the Quicksilver scenes from the X-Men films, but it’s cool to see all the details here. And when a smirking Sonic is tapping his foot on the Transamerica Pyramid while surrounded by missiles, I thought “Yeah, that’s Sonic.”  As expected with kids films, there is some obnoxious product placement. There are at least two references to Olive Garden, and one to Zillow. They’re certainly not as blatant as the Krispy Kreme plugs in the recent Power Rangers film, but they stand out like a sore thumb.  The film is the exception that proves the rule of “Video Game Movies suck.” . It spends far too much time on Earth and the usual kids film cliches, while I believe that it could have done so much more. Why were the Echidnas after Sonic? How does he have his powers? What made Robotnik this way? Sure, we get to see Tails at the end. but it’s that really cheap trick of saving everything for the sequel. If you’re going to make a Sonic film, go all-out and make it a passion project, not a potboiler.",4,Erik T,B0D8HMMSS6,2020-08-11

239,R1LTTIX9PY63P7,Amazing Quality Headphones- you won't regret purchasing these!,"I purchased my first pair of Golrex headphones over a year ago, and have been extremely impressed with the sound quality and durability of these earbuds. I am extremely hard on equipment: I've exposed these earbuds to water and dropped the case multiple times and found that they are extremely durable and will work well in either extreme heat or cold (I'm a Minnesota girl). They still work beautifully and pair almost instantly after 1+ years of everyday use. I like that they included a charging case & cord, both have held up well and are obviously well-made for longer-term use.  I like the design of these earbuds tremendously- they sit very comfortably in the ear and the earbud itself is very sleek and sporty. The instruction manual provided is very straightforward and provides a diagram on how to correctly position the earbud within the ear which I found very helpful. The instruction manual also includes maintenance tips, and what the indicator status in the earbud indicates, i.e.  Power on: White light for 1s; Power-off: Red light for 1s; Pairing mode of the earphones: White light of dual earbuds flash; etc...  The battery life lasts around 2 weeks for me, which is very nice as I can leave them in my gym bag without having to take them out and charge them every night. Pairing and setup are so simple, and I am very happy with how well these have held up with consistent, longer-term use. Cleaning these earbuds is simple as the rubber ear tips are easy to pop off the top. I've also noticed that they don't tend to collect as much wax/debris as some of my other earbuds which is nice.  When I received my earbuds, a QR code was attached to the top of the charging case (see the first image) that gave instructions on how to register the Earbuds with Golrex for a lifetime warranty. This warranty not only includes defects but also damaged or lost products. The icing on the cake here is that you do not have to return the defective items, which as a busy student I appreciate tremendously.  I use the Golrex headphones for lifting, running, and around the house for everyday things. They stay in the ear very well-- I've taken them on 10+ mile runs with zero issues. After 15 minutes or so of wearing them I forget I have them in. I was initially cautious to purchase these, as I figured the quality must be lower due to the lower price but I could not have been more wrong. They have held up better than my Sony & Jlab earbuds which I purchased at a higher price point.  Overall, the GOLREX 100H Playtime was a solid purchase for me, and checked all of my boxes. I needed an earbud that was affordable, durable, with excellent sound quality and noise cancellation that would hold a charge for a long length of time. These earbuds deliver that and more, and I'm very grateful that I gave them a chance. I would highly recommend this product.",5,Hannah,B0D676BXDV,2024-05-22
240,R3KLR9KOU62PFI,An excellent pair of affordable earphones!,"I was in the market for an affordable pair of earphones to use when I'm doing chores around the house or doing a workout on the Peloton. I took a chance and ordered a pair of Golrex T59 earphones...and I'm so glad I did!  These earbuds are very comfortable to wear and the sound quality is excellent.  They store neatly and securely in the recharging case so they're always ready to go the next time I want to use them.  And, the case can be recharged on my wireless iPhone charger so I don't even have to plug in a cord!  Nice!  The manual that comes with the headphones is very well-written and provides clear instructions on their use and care.  And they come with a lifetime warranty from Golrex.  The warranty provides replacement of defective, damaged, or lost product...there's no need to return the product to Golrex.  Overall, the Golrex T59 earphones have been an excellent choice for me.  They are affordable, durable, have excellent sound quality and they hold a charge for a long length of time. I'm so glad that I took a chance on them and I would highly recommend this product.",5,Lanny Lambert,B0D676BXDV,2024-05-27
241,R3733TW9HTX3V6,Fantastic Bluetooth Headphones!,"Let me start by saying I've been through my fair share of headphones. From bulky wired sets to the trendy true wireless kind, I've experienced the good, the bad, and the constantly-falling-out. But these Bluetooth headphones? They're a game-changer. Effortless Pairing and Use: A Tech Novice's Dream Setting up these headphones was a breeze. Gone are the days of wrestling with menus and cryptic instructions. Pairing them with my phone was as simple as flipping a switch – seriously! The connection is rock-solid too, no annoying drop-outs or stuttering playback. Even better, using them is intuitive. A few taps on the controls handle everything – volume, playback, calls – all without ever fumbling for my phone. Stay-Put Security: No More Earbud Escapades Here's the real win for me: these headphones stay put. The over-ear design hugs my ears comfortably without feeling too tight, and the secure fit eliminates the constant worry of them tumbling out during a workout or jog. This has been a revelation! No more scrambling to catch an earbud bouncing down the sidewalk, and no more feeling self-conscious about them slipping out mid-conversation. All-Day Battery Life: Powering Through Without a Recharge Speaking of workouts, the battery life on these headphones is phenomenal. I've been using them for a couple of weeks now, and I haven't even come close to hitting the bottom. The headphones themselves last a good 6+ hours on a single charge, which is more than enough for even the most extended listening sessions. But the real kicker is the charging case. I've gotten at least 6 full recharges for the headphones out of it so far, and it feels like it could keep going – all without needing to scramble for a power outlet. Crystal Clear Audio: A Symphony for Your Ears Now, let's talk about the sound quality. These headphones deliver rich, immersive audio that rivals even the high-end brands. The bass is deep and satisfying without being overwhelming, and the mids and highs are crisp and clear. Whether you're rocking out to your favorite tunes, taking a call, or using them as a discreet hearing aid in noisy environments (guilty as charged!), the sound quality is top-notch. Simple Care: A Low-Maintenance Must-Have These headphones are as easy to maintain as they are to use. A quick wipe with a soft cloth keeps them looking sharp, and the lack of any complicated crevices means no gunk build-up to worry about. The Verdict: A Sound Investment (Without Breaking the Bank!) Look, I can't tell you exactly how long these headphones will last on a single charge – because frankly, I haven't been able to use them long enough to find out. But here's what I can tell you: they deliver superior sound quality, exceptional comfort, and a secure fit that eliminates the earbud-juggling act. The long-lasting battery life, both in the headphones and the case, is a huge bonus, and the effortless pairing and use make them a techie's dream. So, if you're looking for a pair of Bluetooth headphones that tick all the boxes – amazing sound, secure fit, hassle-free use, and long battery life – then look no further. These headphones are, without a doubt, worth every penny. They might not have the flashy brand name, but in terms of performance and value, they leave the competition in the dust.",5,Gary Sailer,B0D676BXDV,2024-05-21
242,R2Y7QQDK0EVFZ,A great pair of earbuds,"My friend turned me on to this company so I bought this pair of Golrex T59 earbuds to try out for myself. I always like to try things out for several weeks before leaving a review so I can really test them out. I am happy to report that these headphones have passed the test! Pairing was easy and the instructions were helpful especially with the wearing of the earbuds.  My usual go to headphones don't have the piece that goes over your ear so the diagram that shows how to position the earbuds within the ear was very helpful. The instruction manual also explains what the different colored lights mean and what function happens when pushing the button on either earbud. The earbud itself is comfortable to wear and the ear hook design really helps keep it in place.  I really like that the charging case itself that houses the earbuds can be charged either with the included cord or with a wireless charger. When my case runs low I just have to set it on my wireless charger and walk away with no cord to mess with. When the case is charging you will see a white light that flashes slowly letting you know that it is being charged. The light will stay solid to let you know when the case is fully charged. You also get 3 different sized rubber tips for a more customized fit in your ear.  I deliver mail and always have one  earbud  in during my delivery day. I am either listening to music, a podcast, or talking on the phone with other carriers. These earbuds sound great on both ends! My friends have commented about how much more clearly they can hear me when we are talking. That says a lot because there is a lot of background noise between my mail truck, the fan in my mail truck, and general outside noise. I can also hear them clearly on my end. I am kind of a basshead when it comes to music and these earbuds do not disappoint. I have turned the volume up as loud as I can stand it and the sound is still clear with no distortion at all. I can use an earbud for about 6.5 hrs on average before I get the low battery warning. Then I just switch sides and continue on with my day.  The Golrex T59 earbuds have turned out to be a great purchase. The fit, sound quality, battery life, and lightweight design make it a great value and I am very grateful that my friend turned me on to them. I would definitely purchase them again and would recommend them to anyone.",5,BKJ,B0D676BXDV,2024-06-18
243,RX9380BYVP64N,Excellent Wireless Earbuds,"The Golrex T59 shows you don’t have to spend hundreds of dollars to get top quality sound from wireless earbuds.  This is a high quality product that is backed by a lifetime warranty - that alone shows how the company feels about the product, and I have used their products in the past and can assure you they stand by their lifetime warranty, no questions ask and no need to return the product back to them.  It arrived in very nice packaging, with a highly sturdy/durable charging case, several sized earbuds (S, M, L), a usb charging cable, and a well written instruction manual.  The things I like most about these earbuds are number one, the sound they produce - as high a sound quality of earbuds that cost hundreds more.  The second thing I am very impressed with is the battery life of this model - it is very long lasting.  Once fully charged, the power will last for multiple hours long sessions at the gym (which is what I used them for), not to mention the comfort fit to your ear.  Again, I use them while working out which is why the design is so nice.  The over-the-ear clip secures the earbud and ensures they do not fall out during high impact activity.  Finally, these earbuds easily pair up with any Bluetooth devices and have excellent range without sound degradation.  You can connect them to any home device and move about the house without losing your connection.  These earbuds are very impressive in every way and you just won’t find a better pair of earbuds for the price!",5,Joemc,B0D676BXDV,2024-05-06
244,R1C5X1IU1AA4HQ,"Comfortable, functional, well made, and reasonable priced headphones.","My purchase of the GOLREX 100H Headphones is now my fourth pair and I continue to be very happy.  I utilize different pairs for workout, travel and at home.  I figure sometimes you loose them so why not have an extra pair.  This new pair reflects some improved tech, the sound quality is excellent and bluetooth is seamless.  While all my headphones have shown exceptional battery life, this new one is even be better.  Much like the other pairs, it’s really comfortable wear for several hours whether being active or just hanging out.  At first, I wasn't sure about the over-ear design but these headphones just fit well with no discomfort. Whats also good about the design is that they are very sleek, but at the same time secure with usable buttons.",5,Dave P,B0D676BXDV,2024-05-30
245,R1VCUV2TPSA7S0,Really excellent wireless Bluetooth headphones,"These are now the fourth pair of these earbuds I have bought. I absolutely love these earbuds. For the money you really can’t beat these. I originally wanted a pair of self charging earbuds that hooked over the ears because my ears tend to be sensitive and hard ones that just shove in my ear I can’t stand to wear for very long.  I can wear these for hours on end with no discomfort. The set comes with different size ear canal sleeves so pretty easy to find comfortable fit.  I’m a musician so I’m pretty particular about sound quality. While I can’t say these are the best in terms of audio quality, they really are very good considering the price point and the features you get. The bass is pretty punching and thick and highs are pretty clear. I’d love a little more in the mids as the mids tend to get a little overwhelmed in the mix with these earbuds but it ok and maybe a little more overall volume but that’s me being really nitpicky. I walk regularly five to six times a week both on a treadmill in my garage and outdoors around my community and occasionally I do some running and these have stayed put in/on my ears no matter what I’ve thrown at them.  I sweat pretty good and that has never caused any issues with any of the sets I have own.  These earbuds are fairly good at sound isolating.  I feel pretty closed off from the world when I’m listening to music or talking on a phone conversation.  I’ve even used these from time to time for a zoom conference call and they’ve performed very well. Self charging in the case and the case itself can plug in or wireless charge.  I really love that these have a screen that shows how much charge is left in the case so I know I always have a way to keep my earbuds fully charged.  It’s also really nice that there are separate indicators for both right and left that show each individual earbud is charging.  They also handle phone calls really well. The built in microphones pick up really well and I have never had anyone complain about audio quality on a phone when I’m using them to talk on the phone. I haven’t had any issues or glitches with any of the sets I have bought. Battery life is a couple hours out of the ear buds themselves, I’ve never managed to drain the case fully before recharging it but I’ve gotten at least 4 earbud recharges out of the case.  I have two complaints with these. The function for adjusting volume with the earbuds isn’t the most intuitive and I usually forget the button sequence to do that so I usually end up adjusting on my device instead of on the earbuds.  My only other complaint is color choice. I really wish I could a set of these in red.  Hopefully someday this will be an option. I really love these earbuds and they tend to go everywhere with me.  I definitely recommend them.",5,Trey Kinsey,B0D676BXDV,2024-05-18

262,RPXWGS2PWXY7G,"Wow, these are great for the price","They really are really nice headsets for the price (29.99 at time of review). Connection is quick upon powering up. It has been working without a single drop. Battery life is very good, easily lasing multiple gaming sessions on a charge and to be more specific, I'm taking real 4-8 hour sessions. The sound quality is  pretty darn good with a decent balance of bass, mids and treble that doesn't have me looking for a way to EQ them. The mic comes through loud and clear. I'm not super sensitive to ear pressure so take this with a grain of salt if you are, but I pretty much forgot they were there while playing. They are light, and don't squeeze your ears/head too tight. I can't think of a negative at this price point. Sure you can get better if you spend much more, but for a budget set, these impress.",5,Aaron,B0D812Z2T1,2024-07-22
263,RETVJ3SMNSK26,"Comfortable, functional and great design!","This was not my first Nubwo gaming headset, I really enjoyed my first, but I was glad to finally be able to get a wireless version from them.  This headset has been fantastic so far! It has excellent battery life and can last me a while week without charging and I’m glad it can be recharged with USB C.  The headset is comfortable to wear even for extended periods of time. I am glad that it has great compatibility with the PS5 and easily syncs up by just plugging the signal into the USB.  I also love the look! When you turn on the headset it has cool neon rainbow lights on the side which looks sweet!  Sound quality has been excellent! Also this is not a noise cancelling headset which in my opinion is much better. I have a wife and 2 kids and prefer to be able to hear if someone is trying to communicate with me without having to take the headset off.  Can’t recommend enough!",5,Joey,B0D812Z2T1,2024-07-02
264,RQ58A1PDJ11FR,Decent Gaming Headset,"Got this for gaming and for work (phones).  Connection is easy, setup is easy, audio is clear.  Mic is decent for a budget headset.  I tried it gaming and works well enough.  Earpads are comfortable, and the lights are attractive.  Would recommend.",4,Jhs1987,B0D812Z2T1,2024-07-24
265,RN9HT1WYCO27U,A nice set of headphones whose value belies it's low price,"If looks were all I was rating this headset on, it would still get high marks. Add those good looks to its solid performance and these headphones are a bargain and a half. The LED strips are really cool and crisp, they have very sharp color representation and decent brightness. Of course, that doesn't matter when they're on your head, but they look like cans that cost a whole bunch more, thus making you look cooler. Sound quality does not suffer from the low price either. In our busy office where we sit 5 feet apart and make phone calls to clients all day, there was nary a complaint about background audio spilling in. Connecting was easy, the USB dongle can be either a full sized 3.0 port or it pulls apart in to a smaller USB-C dongle. Super slick!",5,A. J. Silverman,B0D812Z2T1,2024-07-05
266,RFH72KYTTTUPW,New flavor in your ear!,"My first impression of these, stylish, very comfortable.. you could easily wear these for hours and your ears will never bother you. They have lights on the sides of the headset that not only indicate it's on, but it looks cool.  The mic works right of the box, no drivers.. just plug and play. The sound is crystal clear and the earphones go completely over the ear, sort creating a seal from outside noise. It also comes with a dongle that's easy to install on any computer. If your a gamer, add this to your tool box. Even if you aren't a gamer..it's still useful for video calls. I like it.",5,Pastdolgoal,B0D812Z2T1,2024-07-09
267,R1LL078KXXRV19,"Finally, a Comfortable set of headphones","I'm ancient. I've used headphones since the Nixon Administration and while many have varied in sound quality, almost all of them have proved uncomfortable to one degree or another. Either they don't quite fit over my enormous skull, or the heat builds up in the earphones and I can't wear them after a while.  The NUBW) G05 is great! The set fits easily on my head and it takes a long time for the earpieces to become even slightly uncomfortable. The sound quality is fantastic, without that occasional delay between what's said and when it reaches my ears (this turns most video viewing sessions into an attempt to match talking and lip movement like an old Godzilla movie).  I found the microphone a little weak, but I don't do any online gaming, so this aspect doesn't really bother me.  Performance, and comfort, these are amazing. Highly recommended.",5,Brian K Morris,B0D812Z2T1,2024-07-01
268,R2P0VP7YH6BPW6,G08 headset,"The main use for this headset was going to be on an older DELL PC (OptiPlex 7010 mobo date 2014),  running a version of Linux Mint (Linux Mint 21 Vanessa base: Ubuntu 22.04).  The machine didn't have Bluetooth so a USB Bluetooth adapter was added a few years ago.  After charging the headset I was able to get it to connect to via Bluetooth.  The problem was after using it for 30 seconds it would disconnect. I tried to trouble shoot it but nothing worked.  The problem could have been with the Bluetooth adapter and not the headset.  I then tried plugging in the USB adapter that came with the headset.  In a few seconds it was recognized by the operating system and then I turned on the headset and bingo all was working.  I've used it now for about 8 hours total, maybe 3 different sessions.  Everyone that I've been in contact with said they could hear and understand me with no problems. I was able to hear the game and all the player conversations.  The headset is comfortable to wear and does a decent job of blocking some sounds but it's not noise cancelling and that's fine for my use. I do like that it has a sound level knob/spinner rather than buttons.  I keep getting confused between the Mute and Power button but that's just because they're new. I never did try to use the Mute feature while online but when i accidentally pressed the Mute button the system did flash a notification that my mic was muted.",4,Ken,B0D812Z2T1,2024-07-07
269,R1KE5FDA0NWT55,Solid Wireless Gaming Headset,"I've used NUBWO brand headsets off and on for years, and I've generally been pretty pleased with them. This is no exception. The quality of the sound, both from the headphones and from the mic, is good. It's not going to rival a $100+ pair of headphones, but you can definitely play games and listen to music and enjoy it, and the mic works well enough for streaming or voice chat. I love the dongle it comes with, as it allows you to use the 2.4ghz lower latency wireless setting (lower latency than Bluetooth) with anything with a USB-A or USB-C port that can handle headsets. The Bluetooth also works well. Overall, solid gaming headset.",5,Draknus,B0D812Z2T1,2024-07-08
270,RQ7B2F9RO94KE,Impressive for the price,"This gaming headset delivers excellent latency performance with the 2.4ghz USB dongle. The connection with the USB dongle didn't need any pairing or setup, and the USB dongle was recognized as a sound device right away. The dongle lights up blue when plugged in, which is a nice touch to help you spot it.  The latency is very low in my non-scientific testing, comparable to Razer Blackshark V2 Pro and even faster than some USB wired DACs.  The sound quality is very good for the price but lackluster when you compare it against $200 headsets (I have Logitech G Pro X, Razer Blackshark V2 Pro, Sennheiser, etc. as reference). Still, the sound quality is the best I've seen in a sub $50 headphone category.  The headset is generally comfortable, with some extension and some minimal angle adjustment. There's no rotation on the earpieces. The headset looks good but it's mostly plastic.  The earcup is much better than expected, because I never saw a proper full-sized earcups in this price range. Usually the earcups are small like Bose headphones, but this one is comparable to Blackshark's earcups. These are pleather sealed earcups so the ears will get warm but other than that, these do a great job sealing the sound in.  The mic quality is adequate, but not exceptional. It's good enough for casual conversations or meetings but not high fidelity. To be fair, most wireless headsets also have poor mic quality.  Overall these are very very good for the price, but you'll find shortcomings when comparing to high end headsets.",4,CameraMan,B0D812Z2T1,2024-07-06
271,R25SGWLQN3JODG,Comfy for Long Wear,"I ordered this headset to try because my regular wireless headset isn't very comfortable to game in for extended periods of time. This headset is very lightweight, easy to clean, and has the obligatory RGB (which let's admit IS pretty cool). I had some trouble initially trying to use the bluetooth, but that's because Playstation is not very BT friendly. It does work great on the wireless end though. The sound is very clear when you're listening through them, although I do feel like it lacked some depth. When I gamed with my friends, they said the mic was clear, but that they could tell it wasn't the headset I normally use. I probably wouldn't use this as a dedicated mic while I'm streaming. To be fair, my regular headset is a pretty expensive one that I really love, it's just not comfortable for me all the time. Regardless, I think this is an excellent set, especially for a novice gamer, somebody who's prone to trashing headsets, or somebody that isn't interested in taking out a small loan for a fancy headset.",4,Alice,B0D812Z2T1,2024-06-24
272,R2E9KWSTAG7Q92,Super Privacy and Protection,"My primary reason for buying this iPhone 15 Pro Max screen protector was to ensure my iPhone viewing is private and protected, and it truly delivers on that promise.  Another great thing about it is that it is very sturdy. With my old tempered film, sometimes when I took my phone out of my pocket, there would be scratches on the screen and you really didn't know how those scratches were created. Since using this iPhone 15 Pro Max screen protector from OPXYL, there are no scratches visible on the screen at all, it's very smooth. It has also protected my iPhone 15 Pro Max from falling off a table without damage, and even the screen protector didn't break. I love the OPXYL privacy screen protector and I'll be choosing it in the future when I upgrade my phone.  Super easy installation must be mentioned, it's definitely a disruptive installation, you don't have to worry about misaligning the center of the screen at all because the auto-positioning installation tool will solve all your worries.  It was beyond my expectations to get a high quality screen protector for $10.",5,Ziyuan Zhou,B0D7QFKJK8,2024-07-21
273,RUTD8GZW8J896,Exactly what I’ve been looking for,"I live in NYC and ride subway everyday. There are always people standing next to me in the train looking over my screen which made me very uncomfortable. I always wanted to upgrade my iPhone 15 pro max screen protector to one with privacy protection. I boughtthis one and its completely a game-changer.

274,R3J1QQW2MSAQ2Y,My favorite Privacy Screen so far,"This is definitely the best iPhone 15 pro max privacy screen protector for the money. In comparison to those fragile and breakable glasses, it's obvious that OPXYL privacy glass has been specially processed to be tough and high quality. It has already protected my phone for over two weeks without any scratches (previous screen protectors always left scratches somehow) and it's obvious to see that fingerprints are also greatly reduced. Moreover, the clarity and touch sensitivity are perfect, just like the original screen.  As for privacy, it works as advertised, with a dark screen from the side and very high clarity from the front. The touch response is sensitive and smooth. Perfect for those who want privacy.  Last but not least I have to mention that the installation was absolutely the easiest ever, no need to worry about air bubbles or out of position as there is an innovative dust locator inside, just put it over your phone screen and gently pull to finish. This is definitely designed specifically for people like me with shaky hands.",5,Claire.W,B0D7QFKJK8,2024-07-19

289,R1XPPRG5523PQ5,"Awesome! Rugged, huge storage capacity, fast charging and a light too!","I keep a power bank in the glove box of our SUV for those times when we need juice for our tech and are out and about. The one I had in there before stopped working after about 6 years (I would top off the recharge every three months, so it was always ready to go) but it was a low-end unit that did its job but now it was time for something better! I wanted a power bank that not only had a huge capacity, but was also rugged and could do some solar recharging as we mainly use the power bank at my son's travel baseball games or my daughter's twirling competitions. This way, we don't have to run back to the car for a quick charge when our cell phones and tablets would get low on power. Luckily, I found this very cool Power Bank by Hiluckey that does an excellent job at recharging our stuff! It's super rugged, so I don't have to worry if I drop it off the top of the bleachers or it gets stepped on by one of my kids when they are celebrating one of their great accomplishments and come running over to us! The solar charging feature is a very nice add-on and makes it easy to keep the power bank charged as we use it up over the entire day. It holds an awesome 27,000 mAh of power which can charge up me and my wife's iPhones and our iPad's with no issues and we still have plenty of power to spare! So much power that several parents have asked to bum a quick charge from us. Maybe I should start charging them a fee! Lol! It has three outputs, a USB-C in/out port and two USB-A output ports, so it charge up to three devices simultaneously. And the best part is that at the end of the day and it starts getting dark, you can easily use the built-in 60 LED flashlight to light your way back to the car, 5 Stars!",5,S. Rogers,B0D87CHFQ3,2024-07-20
290,R1KU777QI6LUG2,Days of power,"Awesome solar charger / power bank, with stellar utility and a powerfully large 27000mAh capacity. When this is on a full charge, it can provide a week of power supply (6-8 phone charges, etc). It's got a good hefty feel in the hand using it, and weighs in at just over 1lb. The indicator lights aren’t the easiest to see clearly.  The ability to recharge itself without a plug and a socket is priceless, though not the quickest way to recharge (which depends on sun’s intensity, outdoor temperature, and weather conditions, but is nonetheless a fantastic back-up power source). For travel; packing two charging cables (type A and C), an adapter for versatility, and the included charging cable, is days of power without a second thought. The ports are snug fitting and work good.  The flashlight is surprisingly bright at night and it lit up a really large area (think whole camping area). Finding the power button in the dark on this thing will take a familiar feel I don’t have yet (it blends in without a distinguishing feature).  I did notice when charging in the sun that I needed items to prop up the panel to angle it for the best direct sunlight. I had the thought it needed a small antenna type rod built into the side to use as an adjustable stand… in the meantime, I forage for props. It would have been nice to come with a lanyard or carabiner of some sort, but I found one that works and will also clip onto my rucksack. I’m liking it… nice bit of tech.",5,Brie,B0D87CHFQ3,2024-07-20
291,RRJJBSW2AYL8K,Awesome solar battery pack,This is a great battery pack to have on hand.  We use it at the beach when we are there all day.  It is the go-to battery pack for us.  It's also great to have for emergencies and the only one we can use if the power is out and no one in our family has charged any battery packs.,5,Dadadee,B0D87CHFQ3,2024-07-23
292,RMHKTCNP5R556,"Great charger, rugged, solar is a bit slow to charge","This charger has a TON of juice and charges my iPhone 15 Pro very quickly. Included cables are fine. The solar recharging is rather slow, it didn't indicate that it was charging unless I had it in fairly direct sunlight (indoor light wasn't enough), and it charged fairly slowly, but this is a big battery and the solar panel is not that large, so this is no surprise. I like the very rugged case, especially since I got this for camping & emergency situations. My biggest issue is that the power button to turn on the light is fairly exposed and there is no way to ""lock"" it, which means it's not inconceivable that this turns the light on while in a pack and drains the battery. I dinged a star for the power button and slow solar charging, but don't let either of these issues stop you from buying, they are just places where there is some room for improvement.

295,R1V1U1T68NNEP,Works great,It charges my phone. It can be used as a flashlight or a strobe light (in case of an emergency rave).

297,R1R7UBT680F0CI,great solution for outdoors and off-grid charging,"It's nice to have a powerbank on trips or emergency planning but only to the extent that you will be able to recharge again after 1-2 days at most.  With that, a solar power bank is great because you can be off-grid and still be able to supply power to smartphones, etc.  I don't go camping much but I will keep this one in a bug-out bag.",5,Blue White,B0D87CHFQ3,2024-07-19
298,RAYRU8WGJOUKO,Good to have around if you experience a power outtage and want to stay in touch.,"This power bank is larger and heavier than I anticipated. It's not one that you are going to be carrying around everyday in your pocket, jacket or purse. However I would take it along in my knapsack when hiking. It works well and I'm sure I'll be glad I have it the next time there's a power outage after a hurricane or out on a long or overnight hike. I've seen some larger ones by this company which also feature a hand crank for when there's no sunlight. If you're considering a solar power bank to keep in your home (or vehicle) for emergencies, one of those which would cover an additional base of no sunlight might be an even better bet.",4,MHC,B0D87CHFQ3,2024-07-24

Es ligero, se puede enganchar con la pinza trasera que trae o mediante un imán también en la parte trasera con una tapita. Un productazo de la marca Nulaxy, lo recomiendo al 1000%.",5,Sincera Opinión.,B0D49C85V3,2024-07-20
301,R2QET47R71JBJ0,Carino quanto inutile,"Ero proprio curioso di provarlo perché non ne avevo mai visto uno così piccolino; non mi aspettavo nulla per carità e infatti una volta acceso e riprodotti 3, 4 brani ho capito che era proprio quello che credevo: Un inutile spreco di soldi!  In confezione, oltre allo speaker troviamo un cavo USB-C per la ricarica e i classici manuali d’uso.  BR08 è un minuscolo speaker davvero ben realizzato mediante materiali di buona qualità, con molta cura per i dettagli; ad esempio è molto bella la presenza della stoffa a copertura dell’altoparlante che ingloba anche i tasti di volume e avanzamento al suo interno. Ho molto apprezzato la presenza della clip a molla posteriore che racchiude anche una clip a calamita per essere applicato su ogni indumento o superficie senza problemi. In alto c’è il connettore USB-C chiuso da un coperchio in gomma che evita l’ingresso di polvere o acqua al suo interno.  Si accende tramite l’unico tasto disponibile sulla scocca. Tasto che al suo interno racchiude un LED multifunzione che ci permette di capire se è acceso, se in fase di pairing e altre funzioni.  Collegarlo al vostro smartphone sarà semplicissimo, infatti una volta accesso sarà subito individuabile e accoppiabile al vostro terminale.  Se non fosse per la qualità audio questa cassa sarebbe perfetta, infatti tutto funziona alla perfezione all’infuori della riproduzione musicale. La cassa non ha un volume eccezionale e soprattutto oltre ad essere priva di bassi (me lo aspettavo ovviamente), ha alti impastati e gracchianti anche con un volume medio e non al massimo.  Può fungere anche da vivavoce, in questa modalità è molto comodo perché oltre a permetterci di parlare con l’interlocutore a mani libere si sente anche abbastanza bene e forte.  Non ho altro da aggiungere se non che al prezzo a cui è proposto lo trovo davvero uno spreco assurdo di denaro, non vale assolutamente la pena buttare quasi 40€ per un prodotto simile. Può essere comodo se state facendo un lavoro in cui vi servono entrambe le mani e quindi potete utilizzare questo speaker come vivavoce, ma ascoltarci la musica equivale a prendere una vecchia radiolina di quelle da 5 mila lire comprate sulle bancarelle del mercato del paese negli anni novanta, sintonizzarle su una radio FM non stabilissima e ascoltare tutto il “rumore” che c’è.

303,RLYPSUKSVC050,Impressive Sound and Portability,"Upon taking out of the box, I was struck by the miniature form, the bright +/- volume buttons and tactile grille. The body is made of sturdy matte plastic and the rear has a belt clip along with a strong detachable magnet to clip onto a t-shirt or thin jacket. This is designed to be worn or clipped into a bag so the design of the clip and magnet serves its purpose well but can also be attached to metal surfaces such as onto a fridge.  In terms of audio quality, I am very surprised at how dynamic it sounds for such a diminutive unit. You obviously won't get wall thumping bass from this, but you can certainly hear it clearly and the vocals in particular come out crisp and clean. Detail is here too as I can make out the breaths from the vocalists. For this form factor, this is the best sounding Bluetooth speaker I have ever heard, so I tip my cap to Nulaxy. You also get a fairly decent throw (soundstage/surround) from this unit which does not sound bottled like most  I have been using this little speaker for the best part of 4 hours and it has worked flawlessly connected to my phone. You have the usual voice prompts to signal connection status and also a triple-beep when you hit max volume. The buttons are clicky but feel solid and positive.  Bluetooth connectivity was also strong as I could take my phone upstairs to the back of the house and still clearly here the audio downstairs which did not skip a beat. I love the styling which is similar to another brand beginning with ""U"", the magnet/clip on the back is useful to stick to metal surfaces, clothes, bags making it the perfect pocket rocket to share tunes on your travels.",5,Clear View,B0D49C85V3,2024-07-12

The problem then was that I thought all three lights needed to be lit up to verify connection. When I went upstairs to the tv, I was very happy to see that the smart tv was working great. I love the fact that I did not have to spend a great deal more money to get the job done.Easy setup. Before using this the signal would drop in and out.

Once I installed it, I placed it mid way between my router and where I wanted to extend the signal. I went to my devices and instead of choosing my router I choose the extender and voila!

The three-foot length is what I wanted for the car, and it's long enough to do the job well while also stowing away nicely when you're not using it.  This cable really does seem better made and more resilient than the typical cables you get, especially most aftermarket items. It charges devices as quickly as you'd expect and, again, just does what it's supposed to. One thing I can't comment on is its data transmission capability since I just use it for charging, not computer or other data use.

Battery life is 2-3 hours of talk/audio sound which is longer than many of the other inexpensive earbuds I've bought off of Amazon. I always buy inexpensive because i constantly lose either one earbud or one earbud stops working/charging and I toss them. I'm sure I'm not alone in this, lol.  Charging cord comes with earbuds, as well. 40 minutes to a full charge. I'd definitely buy these again.",5,Shannon,B0D7PBHSZY,2024-07-19

374,R2UE00CZOZQJ89,Works great so far,I grew tired of my USB Port failing on my pixel phones.  I have a pixel 7 and it charges my phone without the case on.  It might actually charge though the Case but I have a pop socket.  Doesn't get hot while charging that I have noticed.  Do yourself a favor and extend the life of your phone(ports) and get a wireless charger. I was hesitant myself but I love the convenience.,5,Brandon e,B0D72SDCQ1,2024-07-18
375,R3F9I1R20YYUY1,"Works well, but not perfect","Plug a USB Type C cable into the back and drop your wireless charging phone on the front and watch it work… maybe. With my phone, it consistently fails after a few seconds if the phone is placed vertically, but it works fine if laid horizontally. That means the induction coils aren’t aligned. Is that the charger’s fault or the phone’s? I’m unsure, but suspect that the vertical coil in the stand is too high to make room for the horizontal coil.  When it works, it works well. My phone’s specifications say that it supports up to 15 watt wireless charging, but I’ve seen between 17 and 18 watts pass through this device. No complaints there, for sure.",4,L. Jacobs,B0D72SDCQ1,2024-07-16
376,R2JYJXKIGWHJH8,Great desktop wireless charging stand,"I ordered this ""Wireless Phone Charger for Android & iPhone - 15W Fast Qi Wireless Charging Station for Google Pixel 3 4 XL 5 6 7 8 Pro Samsung Galaxy S25 S24 S23 S22 Z Flip Fold OnePlus 12 (Black)"" because the bedside charging cradle I'd been using had an altercation with a glass of water in the middle of the night.  The older charging cradle did not win the battle and this wireless charging stand was ordered to replace it.  This is a handy device, especially if you're one to use your smart phone as an alarm clock as I do.  This charging stand is powerful enough to wirelessly charge my iPhone (11) while still wrapped in a case that holds 3 credit cards.  I mention that because I've had 2-3 chargers (very similar to this one) which were unable to charge the phone without the phone case being removed.  No amount of positioning would get those to work - taking off the case was the only way, unfortunately, and in the end I replaced the stands completely.  With this unit I have not had that experience at all, thankfully.  PROS: Charges through thicker phone case. Charging light not overwhelmingly bright. Simple design - plug and play.  CONS: Unit cannot be folded for storage/travel. iPhone charging speed throttled at 7.5 watts.",5,Ric R,B0D72SDCQ1,2024-07-22
378,R103ER2FN5FYBL,Works great!!  Has fast charging and charges through my phone cases with no issues,"This XMANA wireless charger works great and has fast charging.  It charges my phone while its on portrait or horizontal.  It works on both my Samsung S23+ and my iPhone.  For both phones, I have a two-layer phone case and a MagSafe ring adhered to the outside of the case for each phone.  It also charges my Galaxy ear buds 2 pro.  There is a soft padding on the base where you place the phone on the cradle.  The green LED light displays solid when its ready to charge, charging and when its completely charged.  The only time there is was any change in the LED light if there was a charging error, which would cause the light to blink.  I have this at my bedside and the LED light is not too bright.  Like others have already mentioned, this does not include a charging block.  If the company included a charging block, they would just increase the price for the device.  Like cell phones these days, they don't include charging blocks either.  Many people just plug the USB directly into a USB block they already have, or their outlet or surge protector that has USB-C ports.  If one doesn't have these options, it's easy just to purchase a USB-C charging block.",5,VP,B0D72SDCQ1,2024-07-20
381,R1KS5BB8MWR82R,Works great with different phones,"I have both LG and Pixels phones that can be wirelessly charged.  Each phone I've tried (3 different phones) charged quickly but did not heat up the battery while charging or after charging.  I really like the stand which gives me a great view of the phone while charging and is convenient if using the phone for a video call.  No MagSafe, but not that wasn't an issue as the stand provided the proper orientation for phone charging.  PLEASE BE AWARE - the phone does not come with a charger, but does come with a cable.  No included charger wasn't a problem for me.  I have lots of extra chargers and recently changed over a couple of wall sockets to wall sockets that include a USB charging port.",5,Allan Mitch,B0D72SDCQ1,2024-07-16
383,R3CLUGXTB7VG82,"Good charger, but wrong charging cable","Not sure why, but the cable included has a USB-C connector on each end.  The charging unit only has a standard USB plug on it.  This didn't make any difference to me, as I used my own cable to plug it into a high end charger I have.  I like the unit, especially at the low price point.  It seems to be doing a decent job.",4,Pat Traynor,B0D72SDCQ1,2024-07-11

388,R1YCCYM6KJHQDQ,So close to perfect,"I grabbed this looking for a better bedside option to charge all my things. The simple fact that its MagSafe is great for a rock solid connection. Both my iPhone and Apple Watch make great connections and I don’t have to worry about disconnection during charging.  The included power brick and charging cord are great and just as powerful as a 20w power cube in my unscientific testing.  This product could be a perfect 5 star, but the iPhone arm which keeps the charger propped up doesn’t lock into place. So when I remove my iPhone from charging, which is again secured by powerful magnets, the arm falls down. If it were to have little nubs to lock the charging arm in place it would be a perfect 5 star product based on charging performance.  Last is that it folds flat for easy travel portability. I’m on the road a lot for my kids sports so this is easy to drop in my bag based on how small it is and I have 1 thing to plug and all my devices are charging.  If they updated the design to make the phone charging arm lock into place it would truly be a 5 star product.",4,Andy P.,B0D4JM4QPG,2024-07-23

433,R2EGT4Y4CL3SGD,Great quality and fit for Samsung S9+,"Great case for the money.  My nanny asked me to pick up a new leather wallet case for her when she bought her new phone.  I showed her a few options, including this LK case as well as others that were in the $20-$30+ range.  She chose the LK.  I wasn't sure what to expect for a leather case at this price point, but the LK case is on par with some of the more expensive cases out there.  It is sturdy, high quality, looks good, and provides protection around the entire phone.  Others cases feel like cheap cardboard, but this case is thick enough where it doesn't bend from repeated use.  At the same time, it is thin enough to close completely and look sleek.  Having the wallet feature built in is a huge plus as it reduces any chance of forgetting your phone, or dropping your phone because you are carrying too many things in your hands.  Note that the more things you pack into the card slots, then there will be a space between the phone screen and the cover, but that is to be expected.  This is usually noticeable as you pack in wads of cash.  Regardless, it still provides protection as the magnetic flap holds the case closed and the rubber sleeve covers the edges.  There is a built-in rubber sleeve in the case where you put your phone into and it fits great.  It provides protection all around the sides (and back) of your phone while not covering the edge screen.  The fit is secure but easy to get your phone in and out off.  The cutouts for the buttons, headphone jack, and charging port are also a perfect fit and easily accessible while the phone is in the case.  All-in-all, a great case with plenty of protection.",5,Marc Chin,B0D7LN7FP9,2018-05-09

The most noticeable are the lights on the top.  Take a look at the video I posted that shows the 7 settings and gives you an overall look at the speaker.  I prefer the lights off, but you may like the colors, especailly the moving colors.  Behind the little rubber door that stays attached when open are 3 jacks.  One is a usb C port for charging (cable included), and aux 1/8"" jack (no cable included) and  a TF card slot that I haven't seen in others.  I'm sure there are times when you don't want to deal with bluetooth so if you put your music on a micro card you can keep the speaker self contained.  At first I didn't like the sound much, but then I pressed the DSP button and there are 3 eq settings to choose from.  I like bass and one of the settings gave me the bass I wanted.  The speaker has voice prompts that tell you when it's on, when bluetooth is connected etc... .  The speaker quickly and easily connected to my iphone.  You can keep your phone a pretty good distance away from the speaker and it stays connected.  There's also a warning if your battery is getting low.  I ran this speaker for a few hours and it was still going.  The plus and minus switches that I initially thought were just for volume also function as a next track and previous track button respectively.  Short press for volume and long press for track functions.  It also comes with a cord you can tie to the built in loop to make it easier to carry.  It's a pretty good size speaker so someone with smaller hands will like this.  The speaker is built well.  One of the first things my wife did was accidentally knock off a sink onto a tile floor.  Not a scratch.  Finally, it works with siri.",5,Ohio and Florida Customer,B0D6B2MJBP,2024-07-02
456,R3GP998I36J75C,Small but mighty. This speaker delivered beyond my expectations!,"Geektop Arcane A7 Bluetooth Speaker.  What's in the box: -Manual/Quick Start Guide. -The Speaker Unit. -USB C male to USB A male charging cable. -Lanyard.  Button layout: -Power Button/RGB cycle button -Volume Up/Next Track -DsP/Equalizer key -Volume down/Previous Track -Play/Pause Button.  I/O: -USB Type C female port for charging the speaker unit. -3.5mm Aux port -TF Card Slot.  Pairing this speaker with any Bluetooth audio device is within seconds, once successful, speaker is good to go! Speaker operates on Bluetooth v5.1 protocol. Hands free calling is also supported by this speaker.  I have to say I am very much impressed by sound output of this speaker! I never really expect the level of sound quality that comes out of this speaker. Pro Tip: for best listening experience, lay this speaker in a horizontal position with the side of the speaker where the controls are, facing down. The mini woofer side of the speaker can be turned towards or away from your listening angle depending on how ambient you want you music to be.  The default equalizer setting that this speaker comes with gives the best audio output right out the box (in my opinion), though I tried out the other 2 equalizer settings available but both were flat & didn't pump out as much bass & clarity as the default EQ settings did.  Battery life is very impressive. I used this to play music for 11 straight hrs from full charge. Note that how long the battery will stay on depends on how loud the music being played is amongst other factors. Charging time from near empty to full takes about roughly 3hrs!  Another great feature on this speaker unit is the ability to connect audio from an external source via 3.5mm cable to Aux port. Also this speaker support music playback from a SD Card.  Audio Quality: This speaker has a frequency response of 120hz - 18khz & a signal to noise ratio of 82db which means that this speaker is able to output a clean audio with a very decent  balance of bass & treble without any noticeable form of distortion at high volumes.  Overall, this Bluetooth speaker reaaaally packs a punch for something this portable! Produces music loud enough to start a house party (not the neighborhood disturbing kind of course!). This is great value for money! I highly recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a Bluetooth speaker that doesn't cost a whole lot but also delivers very impressive quality audio! I will also be recommending this directly to friends!  This speaker delivers beyond my expectations, I am very impressed. This gets all my 5-stars.",5,Opskie,B0D6B2MJBP,2024-06-20
457,RE669I1I3TFMI,Great little speaker,This little speaker is nice looking but most of all very worth the money. The music sounds great and clear and the quality is amazing. Battery life is excellent and it charges pretty fast. Something I found interesting is that pressing the power button goes through the different light modes. Also helps if you want to turn off the lights. It connected easily to bluetooth.,5,Vanessa,B0D6B2MJBP,2024-06-19
458,R1WKRQD71YO9O8,Perfect Poolside companion!,"Great size and great sound!  This was a perfect speaker for our poolside fun, especially this past 4th of July!  The sound is great regardless of the type of music coming from it.  We listen to country, hip-hop, top 40, etc... and it all sounded great.  The volume is plenty loud enough for not only us in the pool to enjoy, but probably half the neighborhood also!  The bass setting is pretty impressive also.  Setting this up via Bluetooth was a breeze.  I really wish all products paired that easily.  I turned it on, went to Bluetooth on my phone and it was there waiting on me.  Didn't have to hit anything else.  When my wife went to set it up on her phone, it was not already there so we hit the DC button in the middle and it appeared right away.  If anything, I wish it had a ""skip track"" button.  It's not that big of a deal, but for us we have to use our phone if we want to skip a song.",5,Spencer,B0D6B2MJBP,2024-07-08

The 1080p resolution combined with the wide-angle lens produces excellent video quality, perfect for all my video calling and streaming needs.

I especially like the automatic light correction feature, which seamlessly adjusts brightness and color according to the surroundings, ensuring I always look my best in front of the camera. plug-and-play and broad compatibility with various devices and operating systems.

472,R30ANUHZS58L9B,Plug and play,"Bought the most basic one for work. Easy polish and play. Loved that it has a cover, so I didn't need to unplug it all the time like another one I have. This camera is 720p, but the system still shows an option for 1080p. I don't see the difference in quality when switching it back from. Just didn't want all my skin blemishes showing up during work meetings, so I bought a lower resolution one.",5,LavPebbles,B0D6357YDP,2024-07-22
473,R154SM7N4F3ZBD,A must have FaceTime accessory!,"This product has absolutely changed my life for the better which I can't say about a majority of products I use!  The main reason I bought it was because I needed a more efficient way to FaceTime with my family every night. Typically when I get home from work, I head to the kitchen to cook dinner while I let my young son play next to me. His grandparents always call when I'm cooking which leaves me chasing him around with a phone for 30 minutes.  The most incredible thing is that this gimbal has AI tracking and all I need to do is open FaceTime, point the phone at my son and it'll track him while he moves around the kitchen and talks to his grandparents. That means I can focus my time on cooking. I can't say enough good things about how amazing this feature is. I also love that it has a ring light to let you know that the tracking is enabled so you don't need to keep looking back at the phone. This helps because often times I'm staring at the back of the phone when it's tracking my son around the kitchen and I can't see what's happening on the screen.  I did some research and there are a number of other phone gimbals on the market but this one seems to be the best all around with largest variety of features.  I also tried shooting some videos when my son was playing on the jungle gym at the park. I got some super smooth footage and had the Insta360 app edit some content automatically for me. Super nice perk! I didn't purchase it for the video footage but I will most likely be using it on upcoming family trips because of the auto editor.",5,M.D.S.,B0D6QPW32F,2024-07-22
474,R1FQ2H1NXG516C,The Flow Pro is Impressive,"I recently purchased the Insta360 Flow Pro to capture special moments with my kids. As a father who loves to document my family's adventures but doesn’t own a professional camera, having a reliable mobile gimbal like the Flow Pro has been a game-changer.  The first thing that blew me away was the incredible tracking. All I need to do is turn on my iPhone camera app and start filming. Whether I'm recording my kids running around the park or capturing their school plays, the Flow Pro ensures they always stay in frame. No more shaky footage, which is a huge plus when you're trying to keep up with energetic little ones!  The setup was straightforward, and the one-step deployment made it easy to start shooting right away. I appreciate that I don't have to be a tech wizard to use it effectively. The joystick, zoom wheel, and all the controls are intuitive, allowing me to focus on capturing the moment rather than fumbling with complicated settings.  As a parent on the go, I value how portable and lightweight the Flow Pro is. It fits easily into my pocket or backpack, so I'm always ready to capture spontaneous moments wherever we are. The battery life is impressive, allowing me to shoot for hours without worrying about running out of power. It's perfect for those long family outings and vacations.  Overall, the Insta360 Flow Pro has become an essential part of my video-making toolkit. It helps me create beautiful memories that I can cherish and share with family and friends. Whether you're a parent like me or just someone who loves capturing life's moments, I highly recommend the Flow Pro. It's worth every penny!",5,Dabird,B0D6QPW32F,2024-07-23

Cet appareil est tout bonnement idéal pour réaliser des films de qualité avec son iPhone. La stabilité est parfaite et le suivi automatique de personnes est tout juste fabuleux.  Ce produit est à tout point de vue supérieur au modèle DJI (je suis pourtant un grand fan de la marque pour mes drones) et à son prédécesseur Insta360.

Comments made regarding length of handle being short, but the two stage tripod extension means only extending first stage the handle length is perfect. Slight flex when used with built in tripod, however it’s still a bonus to have without requiring an addition of tripod feet to be carried.

494,R17MH8G51XASP6,Apple style. What I tested of it worked as expected.,"Comes in a nice tiny box, ready for retail display I like the stout cable. This will hold up to some use It has a very Apple style to the look of the case and the way the model number  is silk screened on. See photo  When first plug in to the Dell laptop running Win11 an error pops up, but by time I notice the pop up it goes away and starts working. I tested the USB ports with some thumb drives. Everything worked. I also tested the SD and micro SD. They functioned as expected however do note that the cards only insert as far as the edge connectors. They are not taken into the device with a click as one might expect  I ran in to a guy who had the prior version of this adapter and he praised his for how handy it is  I did not test the USB-C power handling or the video output. I mostly needed this to add USB and an SD card reader to my laptop and for that this does the job  Note the caveats in the listing: Only USB-C's that support the DisplayPort protocol can utilize the video output You can only use one SD slot at a time  5 stars unless I find out some feature is not working as expected in which case I will come back and update this review",5,JBurdman7,B0D5XSTWNT,2024-07-20
495,R1OMQ57GURYO0E,Surprisingly long cable makes this more useful than I was expecting,"This is a nice little USB hub that works well with my Mac Mini by offering a few more of the most needed ports in an easy to connect hub. The 12” attached cable was surprisingly longer than I expected it to be (don’t recall the item listing offering that info). As a result, this hub is easier to position on my desk where others have been too close to the computer for easy use. This extra cable could also be helpful for those using it with a laptop or sharing with others in a presentation situation. Also, the wider, squarish design works better on the desk and doesn’t flop around like another compact hub I have. Attachment points on both sides also give more space around the ports, so it's easier to connect and disconnect if using several ports.  The finish is slightly lighter but close to the current Apple graphite color while also complementing the classic Apple silver finish. Fit and finish is very nice and the unit is solid, no rattles, with the cord firmly wedded to the unit and just enough flex. All the USB ports worked as expected and the card reader immediately recognized the SD card and fits firmly in the slot with no vagueness as to how it should insert.  The various connection types are marked in small font printed on the unit so you can at least insure you're using the right outlet for your needs. Sure it’d be nice if they were all powered USB c and 3 connections but that’s just not physically possible from a little add-on, unpowered hub. For what it is, this unit fits the bill and has a new home on my desktop.",5,Cheerwino,B0D5XSTWNT,2024-06-25
496,R1OK7O5HVW8TU4,A Game-Changer for Connectivity: The ABIWAZY 9-in-1 USB C Hub,"I recently purchased the ABIWAZY 9-in-1 USB C Hub to connect my external Samsung SSD to my MacBook Pro, and I must say I am thoroughly impressed with its performance and versatility. This device has been a game-changer for me in terms of connectivity and data management.  The variety of ports offered in this multiport adapter is something I truly appreciate. With 1 HDMI port, 1 power-out USB C charging port, SD/MicroSD card reader, 2 USB A 3.0 ports, 2 USB A 2.0 ports, and 1 USB C 3.0 data port, I can finally connect all my peripherals in one place without having to deal with a mess of cables and separate adapters.  The 4k@60Hz HDMI output has been a lifesaver for me as a video editor, allowing me to effortlessly connect my MacBook Pro to an external monitor for a seamless, ultra-high-definition experience. It has made editing and reviewing my projects a much more enjoyable and efficient process.  The data transfer capabilities of this USB C Hub have been phenomenal. The 20MB/s SD/TF card reader, along with the USB 3.0 and 2.0 ports, enables me to transfer data from my devices with ease, making my workflow smoother and more efficient.  I am very happy to say that the ABIWAZY 9-in-1 USB C Hub has been compatible with my MacBook Pro.  I highly recommend the ABIWAZY 9-in-1 USB C Hub for anyone in search of a versatile and powerful multiport adapter for their device.

I will warn that the secondary USB C port can not be connected to an external monitor. The HDMI port does function in the role but if like me, you have a mobile monitor in your go bag and like to use a single usb cable to connect the monitor you will need to rely on a port on the laptop and NOT this device. Aside from that this hub tested flawlessly providing a single connection for multiple usb devices. It has served the purpose very well I have seen no issues.",4,Alboski,B0D5XSTWNT,2024-06-28
498,R2XJ2II307GVC2,Works perfectly with my PCs and my Samsung Galaxy S22.,"I use this hub with my laptop PCs and with my Samsung Galaxy S22 smartphone to provide additional ports for mouse, keyboard, flash drive, and for micro-SD card access.  PROS: It works with my PCs and with my Samsung Galaxy S22 smartphone.  If you attach a USB-A (male) to USB-C (female) to the USB-C plug, this works perfectly as a USB & SD/micro-SD hub, however it won’t support HDMI out (because PCs only have that capability through their USB-C ports).  That’s no fault of this hub.  It has a USB-C port that you can optionally use to attach a charger for use with higher powered devices like USB-powered hard drives.  This also lets you charge your host device if it is capable of charging through the USB-C port (like my Galaxy S22).  The hub has SD and micro-SD slots that work well.  In addition to the obvious benefit, this is nice because you can insert a micro-SD card into it and leave it inserted so that the hub always has extra storage and can be easily carried in a laptop-PC bag. An inserted micro-SD-card only protrudes about 0.25” (5mm).  An inserted SD card protrudes about 0.75” (15mm).  The hub is small and attractive.  It looks nice on a desktop and fits nicely into my laptop-PC bag.  The hub is metal, which helps dissipate heat and should improve longevity.  CONS: None.",5,Dave Rave,B0D5XSTWNT,2024-06-30
499,R2737ZN330CO3Y,"Multiple ports, great functionality","I use the USB C Hub to connect my laptop to an external monitor display. The hub is a versatile and essential tool for expanding my laptop's connectivity. It offers a variety of ports including HDMI, USB 3.0, USB 2.0, SD/TF card readers, and more, making it incredibly convenient for both professional and personal use.  Pros: Multiple Ports: The array of ports covers most connectivity needs, allowing you to connect multiple devices simultaneously. It features four USB-A ports (two USB 3.0 and two USB 2.0), a dedicated USB-C port, and a 100W power USB-C charging port. High-Speed Data Transfer: The USB 3.0 ports ensure fast data transfer rates. 4K HDMI Output: The HDMI port supports 4K video output, making it ideal for presentations and media viewing. Compact Design: Its sleek and portable design makes it easy to carry around. Convenient Charging: The 100W power USB-C charging port is great for powering any laptop and ensures your devices stay powered without taking up an extra port on your computer.  Cons: Single Display Output: Though this is very clear in the directions, it does lack the capability to add a second display via a DisplayPort or second HDMI port.  Overall, this USB C Hub is a great addition for anyone needing to expand their device's connectivity options efficiently.",5,The Wachiras,B0D5XSTWNT,2024-07-03

But when I plugged it into my iPad Pro, that’s when I was pleasantly surprised it worked flawlessly and instantly was on the screen through the HDMI port.  Then I went ahead and plugged in my thumb drives to see if I could get Files off of them to the iPad which worked great then I went ahead and plugged in a wireless mouse in one of the USB ports, and it worked perfectly on my iPad, which was really cool and it gave me a split screen between my television and my iPad with stage manager.  Also, what was really cool as it was in fullscreen on the television if you’ve ever mirrored your iPad to an Apple TV you know that it doesn’t fill the screen up, but this filled the screen up and that’s what was a big surprise.. .  So this is a great product and it Definitely works on the iPad Pro.

502,R3MQ3E3FPSKUKW,Nice addition to newer computers,With newer computers being built with only two USB ports in front this is a nice addition.

It’s a two minute setup and scan.  I was pleasantly surprised at the number of channels this picked up and the amazing picture quality.  I had owned the old style thin plastic you hang in the wall.  What an upgrade!  It hides behind the TV nicely for a clean look.  The price was amazing too.  Almost half of the flat style prices.  I tried to count the number of channels this picked up but stopped at 60.  Great variety from old movie musicals and westerns etc.  to true crime and even an old game show channel.  I’ll have no problem finding something to watch!  I would definitely recommend this.  For the price and ability to return,  what do you have to lose?",5,Lisa Miller,B0D8K27YHS,2024-06-29

Connected the USB in the back and had my TV search for channels (check your TV manual or YouTube). Easy installation, long cable. Had to move the antenna part around the TV to get the best signal. I haven’t moved it since then.  Worked like a champ!!!  Next thing I knew I was watching Wheel of Fortune. LOL  Getting another one for another TV.",5,SL Pn0iBoi,B0D8K27YHS,2024-07-21

My TV is not near a window, is on the first floor, andI positioned it on the wall about 10 ft. off the floor  (the distance above ground level), using the enclosed double sided stickey strip.  I had previously checked on line for TV analysis maps to find the best place for the most channels.  Up 'til now I was getting from five to seven clear channels both on the original plastic square adhesed wall antenna as well as the Amazon one recentlt purchased. After placing this antenna in the same location (albeit 6 inches higher up the wall since the previous one had to sit atop a tall curio cabinet) , I was shocked when scanning for available air digital channels when the scan went past 7 and ended with 36 channels which locked into the memory.  The picture is fantastically clear and the channel selections are more than I could have imagined, having beel limited to 5 for the past several years. DUH! At age 84 the ups and downs the ladder for multiple location changes was getting tiresome!  In a nutshell, I LUV, LUV, LUV this antenna!",5,Amazon Customer,B0D8K27YHS,2024-07-12

First, I checked to make sure that I was in a market that broadcast the channel and had a tower in range. I am 26 miles away from the tower so I thought this would be fine. I plugged the antenna up with the booster and placed it in the top of my window and got about 20 channels but not the channel that I wanted. I moved it to another window and picked up more channels but still no MeTv toons. I went back and read the reviews for this antenna and tried using it without the booster and not placing near the window and rescanned again and it worked like magic!!!",5,didi,B0D8K27YHS,2024-07-07

I bought a 2-pack, tried installing the first one, and the screen cracked when I was aligning. Fine, bad luck, let's do the 2nd one. Installed it perfectly, but when I tried to re-register my fingerprints. A notification popped up, ""make sure Fingerprint sensor is clean and dry then try again"". What am I supposed to do? Remove the screen protector to clean the sensor? breaking the 2nd screen in the process? 5 days passed and the fingerprint scanner is STILL ""wet"", and I can't register new fingerprints. Screen is sometimes unresponsive, It was just a bad experience in general and I have no idea how this product gets such high reviews.",1,Hung Nguyen,B0D77SHSB7,2024-06-30

The second one doesn't stick properly.  When I text I can hear/feel the ""protector"" gripping and releasing from the screen.  Because it doesn't stay down properly I'm not able to use my fingerprint to unlock my phone because.  This was a huge waste of money.  I purchased this product because it had 42,000+ reviews.

544,R391YU3I2UKBJV,Would not work with the fingerprint sensor,"I could not get this screen protector to work with my fingerprint sensor, no matter what I tried. I increased the sensitivity, tried cleaning phone again and reinstalling, and I tried the second protector in the box with the same result. You can visibly see the circle on the screen protector and there is some additional adhesive in that circle. I tried pressing very firmly and squeezing any kind of a air or anything out of the circle and could never get it to recognize my fingerprint. I also tried registering new fingerprints with the protector on, but it kept asking me to make sure my finger was fully in the circle and would never register the new fingerprint.  The rest of the protector seemed fine and I was able to do everything else on the phone except for fingerprint logins. I use the fingerprint sensor a lot, so this was a no-go for me and I ended up throwing them away.  If you don't use the fingerprint sensor, this might work for you, but you WILL visibly see the circle all the time. It really stands out when looking at the screen.

Yes, it does fit my s22 Ultra but didn't adhear to the screen in some areas so there are dead zones. Do yourself a favor and spend your money on a better product.

558,R3MRF1693S4G80,BUY IT NOW!,"I one hundred percent recommend the Hyzom WiFi repeater. Me and my newly wedded wife moved into a small house next to some friends of ours. However, we did not have any internet connection and no way to watch our shows, movies, or sport channels. The phone service is not the best at our place either, so watching things on my phone was out of the question. I was not wanting to pay for a whole WiFi network plan since it is so expensive, so I looked into some internet extenders. After talking to my neighbors and getting their okay to extend off their network, I bought this repeater to boost off of their router. We only had one problem: their house is over 200 yards away. I knew there was no way it could reach the router from there, but I thought we would give it a try. I unboxed the repeater, plugged it in, and followed the instructions. The instructions were very straight forward, which was a great help, as I am not too bright when it comes to putting things together or making things work. I followed the instructions step by step, and to my surprise, it connected to the wifi. My phone connected immediately, so the next step was to try the TV which has a firestick with it. I followed the same process to connect the TV to the repeater, and it was all working smoothly. Now we are able to watch our shows and sport channels without having the hassle of paying for an extra internet bill. Paying for this repeater definitely saved us a lot of money! Here are some things that are great about this repeater: First of all, it reaches throughout the entire house. The strength is the same in every single room, and we have no trouble with buffering or blocking videos. The power tends to go out at our house a few times, so I am looking forward to seeing how this affects the extender. Secondly, the repeater is very small and white, so it is very easy to conceal and it does not get in the way of our decorations or furniture. Thirdly, the repeater is listed at a very affordable price, especially for those who are not looking to pay for an extra bill. Fourthly, this repeater does not interfere with the connection at our neighbor’s house. A lot of previous repeaters have slowed down the internet speed all together, causing both the original router and the extender to be extremely slow. Last but not least, the range of the extender is quite surprising. Even before I reach home, as I drive down the road, my phone connects to the internet. To anyone who has read this entire review, if you are having trouble with your internet connection being slow, or trouble getting it to reach all the rooms in your home, I highly recommend this extender. I have recommended it to my boss at work, and she is planning to purchase one as well, as her two story house can take a lot of wifi to be able to reach the entire house. Tremendous product!",5,Jordan Waddington,B0D9NJHCKF,2022-09-15
559,RQDI1D6CMPE7T,Easy to set up and reliable,"The great advantage to this product solution is that it is fast and easy to set up. I used this product to extend the coverage area of my WiFi around my house and it worked perfectly. It extended the range outside as well and now I am never left without coverage. At the end of the day, the most important thing is knowing what exactly you are looking for and how you want to do your networking and this is a perfect solution to any networking range issues.",5,Katrina Williams,B0D9NJHCKF,2022-03-12
560,R3G69K5AD18V40,WOW that was surprisingly easy!,"Just got it today to help my security camera link to my router about 70ft. away.

Put it halfway between the router and the camera with 2 walls between each and it shows strong signal now. Easy peasy!!!

566,R39EKZK9QH37NF,Very Surprised on how well the Range Extender works,"Actually TRULY AMAZED. I had purchased a 3 piece bundle of Range extenders at 3 times the total cost of the HYZOM. They worked intermittently and had to be Reset almost daily. After a week I sent them back and tried 1 of the HYZOM's and another brand similar to this unit. The HYZOM and I use it in Bridge Mode worked FLAWLESSLY, while the other similar unit had about half the range and was noticeably slower in transmitting speed. To Connect the HYZOM take less than 2 minutes. I now have 3 of these HYZOM Extenders and have NO BUFFERING WIFI/Internet for almost 4200sqft and one in in my 30x50 Aluminum Work Shop over 100 feet from the main WIFI Router and has to go through 3 walls and the external wall of my home is Brick, across the large Patio area through the aluminum siding to get to the Extender.  I do have 1 in Router Mode and so far it works just fine so Ill leave it like that for now. GREAT Bang for the Small Dollar these cost versus the Multi have to plug in and find a space for units. Just plug it in, link it to your WIFI and your done. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND these Range Extenders.",5,Sarah,B0D9NJHCKF,2022-03-12

Just as soon as I plugged it in it prompted me to connect to the best Wi-Fi. Now my children are much happier, my wife is happier and I am happier.  I recommend this booster to every family that has troubles connecting in  rooms that are far from the Wi-Fi incoming.

572,R10NGLOO30534F,3 1/2 stars,"I got this watch for Prime Day. The original price at the time was $91, however I got it for $21. Big discount! I thought, since it's expensive when not on sale so it must be pretty decent, plus it has good reviews. Unlike the other 56 I looked at. Anyway, for $21, it's great! here are my pros and cons: Pros: 1. gives me notifications that are on my phone 2. has unlimited sports modes to choose from 3. tracks steps, calories, heart rate, etc. 4. cool bgs to choose from 5. maintains battery well 6. you can adjust the size a lot. I have a very small wrist so I rarely find things that fit my wrist and this works 7. tracks your sleep, as long as you're wearing it, which leads me to my cons. 1. not very comfortable 2. has to be connected to Bluetooth to receive notifications, listen to music, etc. 3. when you call someone your phone has to be connected to Bluetooth directly to the watch and calls from your phone anyway so there's literally no point to have that feature. That is all the pros and cons I can think of and as you can see there are more pros than cons so up to you if you want to buy. hope this is helpful!",3,Danica Smith,B0D78H29R8,2024-07-20

This has significantly reduced errors and improved the overall presentation of my packages, enhancing customer satisfaction.  The seamless integration with major shipping carriers like USPS and UPS streamlines the shipping process further. I can easily generate and print shipping labels directly from their respective platforms, saving me valuable time and effort.  Another aspect that sets this printer apart is its compact and sleek design, making it a perfect fit for my small office space, especially since there are no label feeding tray in the back of the printer, but everything is integrated inside it.  Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of this label printer. It has streamlined my shipping processes, improved efficiency, and enhanced the professionalism of my business.

The labels that come out are always clear and I've never had to worry about ink smearing the actual label either. The amount I've spent on this printer and the stickers has been way cheaper on me than using my inkjet printer. I was able to easily connect it to my laptop and once my labels are ready, I just hit and I can do a batch print. Rather than waiting what seems like forever to print, I can get everything done way faster. I'm also able to print invoices that I put inside of my packages with this printer too.

609,RYMC3YC4JOZDG,Amazing with a few fixable problems,"Here are the pros and cons of these headphones that I've found  Pros The battery lasts forever. I turned them on about an hour before I went into work and they finally died about 10 minutes before my 12 hour shift was over. Sound quality is really really good The range is honestly surprising. I can go almost a whole room further away from my phone than most other headphones I've bought  Cons The control box/battery box thing on the forehead starts to hurt after a few hours,and would probably eventually rub a bald spot onto your head, but both of those are easily fixable by stuffing some padding into the band in between the box and your head. If you wear glasses, the band kind of squeezes your ears against them, which kind of hurts and will make you readjust it alot The speakers will move around inside the band, so you'll have to readjust them every time you put it on and sometimes while you're wearing then The band will slip off your head or down over your eyes constantly, though that just might be a me thing, since I've always had that problem with headbands  Honestly, these are so much better than I'd thought they'd be. Definitely worth the price",5,Gwen,B0D739N97N,2024-07-07
610,R2LMKOQ0DL3X3D,Exceeded my expectations,Such a cool and innovative product! I bought this for my morning runs and it has exceeded my expectations.

Although I give just these cloths a ""Very Good"" score, will most likely complete further cleaning with my nice microfiber towels...not only nicer quality and cleaning capability (and of course, MUCH less abrasive) but big enough to be folded over.  Lastly, detaining any points on this set for the box would be unfair. I've received dozens of similar weight/sized boxes without damage.

The cleaner is mild - I don't think it's going to do much about the soda pop that came out of your nose 3 months ago, and it's good it won't - it means there are no harmful solvents in it that will damage your screens.  Unfortunately they don't print on the bottle what it actually is; there's a vague blurb that says nothing.  The two micro fiber cloths are nice.

626,RKF8J7MQ3C8SP,Too little safety info on what is in the bottles,"I see that this product gets almost entirely very high marks for being a product that effectively cleans screens. And how well a product does the job that it is designed to do is one of the top criteria I consider before deciding to purchase a product. But the most important criteria to me, is whether a product is safe or potentially harmful. On the box, and on each bottle, it reads: ""Major constituent Surfactant, organic solvent, preservative, fragrance, etc."" According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website, ""Organic solvents can be carcinogens (cancer causing), reproductive hazards, and neurotoxins."" So, of course, I want to know whether the screen cleaner in the bottles are safe, or whether they might be harmful to use. Is the solvent used safe if it comes into contact with my skin or is inhaled? The fact that it has a ""fragrance"" implies that some fumes are anticipated to be inhaled. When I typed my safety question on the product page, the AI generated response said, ""The screen cleaner is safe to use as it is non-toxic, alcohol-free and fragrance-free. It is also plant-based and environmentally friendly."" However, on the product label and on the box, it reads, ""...preservative, fragrance, etc."" Nowhere does it say fragrance-free. And, what are the preservatives and what is the etc? Many products will list active ingredients, supplemental ingredients, and inert ingredients. This product does not list a single ingredient. While the product does state that ""It is forbidden to eat,"" nowhere can I find what the active ingredients are and whether the product is safe to touch or smell. And nowhere does it say that this product is non-toxic. If accidentally ingested by a child, what do I tell the folks at the Poison Control Hotline? This product may be perfectly safe, and maybe it is actually plant-based and environmentally friendly just as the AI description claims. But if this is the case, then why is this critical information not provided anywhere on the product or product page? While the product does work well, and the microfiber cloth works well but could be bigger, I cannot give this product more than three stars as long as there is no information telling me just what sort of chemicals I may be exposing myself to when I use this product.",3,Steven Wills,B0D4XZWYZ5,2024-07-17

791,R1HIHJ0MX8JHAT,Their best controller yet!,"I've owned some version of most 8bitdo controllers over the course of many years and every time a new model comes out, they improve on it in some way. The last one I was using is the Ultimate Bluetooth Controller for Switch/PC/etc. It was their first (I think) to include hall effect joysticks and has served me well. However, one of my long-standing complaints was that there were no anti-friction rings around the thumbsticks, so the feel was a little rough. I saw this finally had some and wanted to give it a try.  In terms of general form factor, it's more of the same, which is a good thing. The biggest difference is that there are no back buttons on this one; there are still extra buttons, they're just moved up to the top and act as secondary bumpers. I have no issue with this as they are still easy to reach, but if you have smaller hands, that could be a problem. It also means that you are giving your index fingers another button to push instead of using your middle or ring fingers that otherwise don't do anything, but ultimately I see this as a sidegrade, not really an up or downgrade.  A lot of other things have changed, though. This one has clicky bumpers, just like an Xbox controller, anti-friction rings around the (hall effect) thumbsticks that are buttery smooth, and a clicky d-pad, again like an Xbox controller. Except... it's not THAT clicky. It's more similar to their usual rubber dome d-pad, but with a slight click. The best of both worlds, really: the general feel of a rubber dome d-pad, but with the tactile authority and accuracy of a clicky one. I absolutely love it.  The face buttons don't use this mushy/clicky feel, though, probably to save money. They are a bit louder than the other controller but on par with an Xbox controller. I do wish they'd used the same tech as the d-pad, though, as it's really satisfying.  The biggest downgrades are that this does not include, nor is it compatible with, a charging dock. I wish it had the contacts so it was at least compatible, but it's not a huge deal. It also doesn't seem to work with the Ultimate Software, instead having you remap the L4 and R4 buttons on the controller itself. This works fine, but does mean you can't rebind the other buttons. The manual mentions Ultimate Software V2 for firmware updates, but I don't see this software anywhere on the web site, so maybe it's not out yet. Regardless, this controller is half the price of its bigger brother, so it's an understandable cut and honestly not that big of a deal.  Oh, and it comes with a color-matched (perfectly, I might add) USB cable, which is just a neat touch. I cannot say enough good things about this controller, it is seriously the best deal out there right now. Just buy one.",5,Nick,B0D72TNXSC,2024-07-25
795,R1YKVGWSCV2MXS,iPad Pro M4 2024,"I chose this for my new iPad Pro 2024 M4. I wasn’t 100% sure when I chose this multiport adapter from KIROSA was going to work with this new device, but everything on the listing indicated that it would. The reason I chose this was twofold. I use a cheap pair of plug-in wired earbuds that fit my old iPad with a 3.5 mm jack. I wanted to be able to use them on my new iPad since at work sometimes I need to get up and run. I pull out my earbuds and throw them on the table. I didn’t want to do that with wireless earbuds. I also wanted a device that would allow me to read full-size and microSD cards to view photos from a hunting camera. In the past, we had had to use a full size laptop to view them. When I plugged this multi port adapter into my new iPad, it immediately recognized it and everything looked great. Then I plugged my 3.5 mm headphones into the Jack and my iPad popped up and said are these headphones or another device I answered headphones and loaded a video. The audio is actually better than it was on my old iPad with these old wired earbuds When I put the full sized SD card into the multi port and attached it to my iPad, my iPad started immediately downloading the photos. We were able to stop the download and choose not to keep the file. ( guessing this is an iPad setting ). So the sd card reader works too. My rating is 5 stars.",5,Mazy G.,B0D4QCRS7S,2024-07-21

What an upgrade!  It hides behind the TV nicely for a clean look.  The price was amazing too.  Almost half of the flat style prices.

Also the antenna channels just get added to the Samsung TV channels.  Once I googled this and figured it out, it worked great.  Maybe some of the people who gave it bad ratings will read my review.

I had previously checked on line for TV analysis maps to find the best place for the most channels.  Up 'til now I was getting from five to seven clear channels both on the original plastic square adhesed wall antenna as well as the Amazon one recentlt purchased. After placing this antenna in the same location (albeit 6 inches higher up the wall since the previous one had to sit atop a tall curio cabinet) , I was shocked when scanning for available air digital channels when the scan went past 7 and ended with 36 channels which locked into the memory.  The picture is fantastically clear and the channel selections are more than I could have imagined, having beel limited to 5 for the past several years. DUH!

866,R1U34CVVUFL835,Decent camera for kids - bigger with small screen - not rechargeable,"Overall, I wasn't that impressed with this kid's camera. It's a bit larger than I expected. Compared to the size of the camera, the screen is small. The most elaborate part of the camera is the Bluey character on the front. Another thing that was disappointing was that the camera runs on batteries and is not rechargeable. Rechargeable is always better. Other than that, the camera works decently and I like that it came with a memory card. Like most kids' cameras that I have come across, it has a few games on it too. Overall, the camera works decently, but there are better options out there.",3,D,B0D45WN7G9,2024-07-20
867,R2CJUUKTIEBPWF,A nice digital camera,"I thought my granddaughter would appreciate this and she does! I have purchased many digital cameras in the past and this one is okay. It comes with memory but not batteries. It takes 3 AA batteries and you need a Phillips screwdriver to add and remove them. You can take pictures, videos, and play games with the camera. Again it’s just okay, figuring out how to choose the choices took a minute (clicking the camera shutter button on the top), but it is what it is. Within the first 30 minutes, she managed to lock up the camera, which took screwing the battery out by again locating the Phillips screwdriver to loosen the cover. After that, we turned it on and it was fine.",4,Kenneth B Stanciel II,B0D45WN7G9,2024-07-17
868,RXGXVP3X1YS37,A Perfect Snap for Little Photographers! Pretty big.,"I recently bought the ekids Bluey Kids Camera for my grandkid, and it looks like a fantastic choice for young photographers. The camera is super easy to use, with big buttons that make taking photos a breeze. The built-in memory card is handy, and it’s nice that it’s ready to go right out of the box. My grandkid will love decorating their photos with the cool Bluey-themed frames and stickers. Plus, the little screen is perfect for viewing pictures and videos. One downside is that it requires 3 AA batteries, which I didn’t realize I needed to buy separately.  All in all, this camera seems like a great way for kids to explore their creative side and capture fun moments.  + Easy controls + Fun decorations + Includes SD card + Built-in games + Colorful screen  Hope this was helpful!",5,Carlos Pena,B0D45WN7G9,2024-07-23

880,R2JUU0Y5B6WGPV,There are four Riddick Movies - But this one can stand by itself,"Spoiler Alert, I'm going to cover a lot of details about this movie. If you don't want to read this then stop now and just watch the movie. It's worth the time and if you like fast paced Sci-Fi you will enjoy this movie.  First and foremost, I love the Vin Diesel character ""Riddick."" But truth be told, if you don't go for this type of Sci-Fi then just watch ""The Chronicles of Riddick (TCOR)."" It is one of my favorite movies. This movie picks up where TCOR left off, with Riddick bored and paranoid after assuming the role of the Grand Marshal. You simply have to watch TCOR in order to get this. He arranges with some of his enemies to take him back to his home world (Furia). But instead, he winds up on ""not furia."" A backstabbing betrayal by the Necromongers leaves him stranded and slightly wounded on this far away hostile planet.  What follows is a great story of adaptation, survival and good old fashion ""I'm the alpha and you would have saved a whole lot of lives and butt-kicking if you had just started with that."" But no, after battling through some really hideous, poisonous and downright scary reptile like monsters and befriending a really cool looking alien dog (the dog steals the show with every appearance) Riddick emerges in to a fairly safe part of the planet with no monsters (as of yet).  He stumbles up on an abandoned relay station and sends out a distress call.  Two different ships of mercs show up to try and hunt him down for the bounty on his head. What happens after that is some really good story telling by whoever made up this story. At this point if you want to find out what takes place in this final installment for the Riddick franchise I suggest you watch the film. This movie will not win any Oscars, but the action, suspense, drama and CG effects are outstanding. There's LOT'S of action and plenty of Riddick slays the bad guys (Heck Riddick slays everybody, good and bad). Some great one liners and Katee Sakhoff and Matt Nable, both deliver great performances. It helps a lot if you are familiar with the earlier works, especially ""Pitch Black"", but if you are not you should still enjoy this film.  I hope you find this helpful, and you keep a stiff spine.",4,W. Gordon Brown,B0D9F79XRT,2023-11-07

I have an Apple keyboard with an integrated case. It only has two angles. It is expensive and very heavy. This case has a removable keyboard which is great when you don’t need it. But it does not have a trackpad. I rarely use a trackpad because I use external keyboards for my Mac not the built-in one. Others may find this a dealbreaker. But you cannot beat this price.

You will get the charging case, the earbuds, a charging cable, different size sleeves and user’s manual. Using them is straight forward and well described in the user’s manual.  The most impressive feature is the modern curvy design. Item comes very well packaged with good quality materials. You will get the charging case, the earbuds, a charging cable, different size sleeves and user’s manual. Using them is straight forward and well described in the user’s manual.  Charging case lid is sturdy and firm. Earbuds snug nicely in place in the charging case and the magnets hold the earbuds in position firmly. Pairing to my cellphone was fast and charging the earbuds was quick.  Earbuds fitted very well in my ear and held up nicely. I did some running and weightlifting with them in my ears and had no issues with them falling down. Earbuds held up in my ear without a problem. The box does come with small, medium, and large size earbud sleeves to fit the needs of your ear. Earbuds come with the medium sleeves already installed which are the ones that fitted perfectly in my ear. Sleeves are soft and adapt to your ear shape well not like other brands that after awhile they start hurting your ear canal. Earbud sleeves close nicely against your ear omitting many outside noises.  I was very impressed with the sound quality. These earbuds sound just like my old more expensive high-end earbuds. Sound quality is snappy yet refined to the delicate audiophiles. I tested a range of music from EDM, Reggaeton, Country, Classical, Pop and Rock. All tracks sounded crisp. I have to say that the sound quality is very well balanced. You get good lows, crisp mids and clear highs. I have tested several earbuds in the $150-200 range that sound like crap by overwhelming lows and highs over mids or by enhancing mids by sacrificing lows and highs.  Overall, I am very satisfied with the product and highly recommend the product to anyone that likes cool modern designs and good sound quality.",5,Waddle,B0D66QZQ2Y,2023-09-25
890,RTXNH1FF61JNU,"Works well, mike is good, sound is fine","These work well. They initially paired quickly just by opening up the case to put it into pairing mode. Once initially paired, re-pairs quickly when taken out of the case and turns off right away when put into the case. The Bluetooth stays connected. On my Samsung phone I can connect to both this and a galaxy watch via Bluetooth at the same time. The % case charge remaining is a great feature and there are flashing indicator bars on the case to let you know each is being charged. The display does turn off after a little while (unsure if its just by time, or whether the buds are fully charged). The case is nice and light and small but seems solid and is a slightly tactile plastic, not the real slippery kind. The earbuds are a very light, comfortable and fit without seeming like they will fall out easily. The microphone quality is good. The sound quality is fine although not too hi-fidelity for serious music listeners, but that is to be expected because of the size and these don’t have silicone earbud coverings. The case top is magnetic, attached to the rest of the case, and the buds fit securely into the case via a magnet and are easy to get out of the case.",5,alanp,B0D66QZQ2Y,2023-08-08
891,R3MU22HPACNVKT,"Fantastic, affordable, high quality earbuds!","I absolutely love these earbuds. I am so impressed with the quality, especially for such an affordable price. I love the sleek, small design of the case that will fit easily in a pocket or purse. The battery status indicator on the front for the charging case and both earbuds is such a cool feature, so I always know when it's time to charge them up. The earbuds themselves were really comfortable in my ears and have a beautiful, sleek design as well.  I love the button on the back of the earbuds for the controls (play, stop, answer calls etc.) because it is easy to find and use.  Other earbuds that use a touch design have been frustrating for me because when I adjust them in my ears, I wind up doing things I don't mean to, like hanging up on a phone call. So I truly appreciate the design of these earbuds.  They were very easy to connect to my Samsung phone and the quality of the sound is awesome. They sounded great when watching movies, listening to music and talking on the phone.  I recommend these earbuds to anyone looking for a fantastic pair of earbuds at an affordable price. You won't be disappointed!",5,Julie C.,B0D66QZQ2Y,2023-08-23
892,R1XITGEKXG8ZG5,Love the new size of the charger and carry case!,"I had the earlier version of these and they had a large battery.  It was a good design because the large battery could also be used for charging your phone because it had a USB port.  But I digress, let's talk about the new ones!  I have always had problems with trying to keep earbuds IN my ear, they were always falling out.  These seem to be the perfect ergonomics as I haven't dropped one yet.  I gave them a 5 on sound because I use the clunky over-the-head sound canceling ones and there is no way to get that with ear buds.  But the sound of music or TV (Bluetooth to the TV so I don't disturb my hubby) is great!  Clear, crisp and the battery hasn't run out yet.  In fact they came already charged, a nice touch.  Packaging is very nice, would make a nice gift because it isn't in some plastic bag.  The unit comes nicely boxed with a foam insert that is made to fit exactly.  I did have a learning curve... to get them out you have to push sideways a little.  Maybe just my stumbly fingers, but now I know the secret to getting them out easily.  All in All, great product and price for a compact setup!",5,PJAXON,B0D66QZQ2Y,2023-09-03

I also find them very comfortable to wear for extended periods and they stay put. The case is small and the earbuds snap easily into charging position. The display of charging status on the outside of the case is also a very nice feature.  Definitely a good choice if you are looking for value priced earbuds.",5,Mr. T D,B0D66QZQ2Y,2023-09-09
894,R2DN1K0LXO8KYJ,Fantastic Wireless Earbuds with Impressive Features,"I recently purchased the Occiam wireless earbuds and I must say, they have exceeded my expectations in every way possible. I was impressed by their sleek and modern design. The earbuds fit comfortably in my ears and stayed securely in place.  The sound quality of these earbuds is great. The audio is crystal clear, whether I'm listening to my favorite music or taking calls, the Occiam earbuds deliver an enjoyable experience.  One of the standout features of these earbuds is their impressive battery life. With a single charge, I can enjoy up to 8 hours of continuous playback, which is perfect for long commutes or extended gym sessions. The charging case also provides an additional 40 hours of battery life, ensuring that I never run out of power when I need it the most.  The Occiam wireless earbuds are also incredibly convenient to use. They seamlessly connect to my devices via Bluetooth, and the touch controls on the earbuds allow me to easily adjust the volume without reaching for my phone. The earbuds also have a waterproof rating, making them resistant to sweat and rain, which is ideal for active individuals like myself.  I highly recommend the Occiam wireless earbuds to anyone in search of a high-quality audio experience.",5,Ken N,B0D66QZQ2Y,2023-09-11

The added ability to wirelessly charge the case is a nice touch. Besides that, it has all the features you'd expect, with quick connectivity, good range, good sound quality, solid battery (in my experience so far), and a small, sleek case.  Some might prefer a touch-sensitive interaction over the physical button on these buds, but in my experience the touch-sensitive approach leads to a lot of accidental pausing and track skipping. So the button is an improved experience in my opinion.",5,Johnny Coster,B0D66QZQ2Y,2023-09-23
896,R3LGNNQ5Z54MVZ,"Comfortable, Good battery life, low-profile and they don't fall out","I usually avoid this style of earbud because I'm worried about them falling out but these seem to do great. I'm not doing any vigorous activity with them but I'm on my feet moving around all day and I haven't had an issue.  I like how small and low-profile the case is and the earbuds themselves. They feel well-made. The other nice thing about this style is that they allow you to hear your surroundings as well. Sometimes I want to block out sounds around me, and sometimes I want to be able to hear when my wife is saying something to me from the other room while I'm cooking, or hear when a cyclist is about to pass me on a walking path. These allow for that. You sacrifice bass response for that but for general listening and particularly podcasts/audiobooks these have great clarity.",5,mybedsonfire,B0D66QZQ2Y,2023-09-18

The recorder is very well made, and since it is magnetic, can be placed in extremely discrete environments. I was able to quickly charge the recorder and easily get it up and running. My initial test was to make sure it didn't crop breaks in natural speech. The sound quality was pretty good, clear enough to understand, but not clean enough to be a true audio source. The ONLY ""downside"" is the need for a charge cable in order to keep the device charged and constantly in use.

You can also use the + - two buttons to switch some functions, which is very convenient. Great product that is easy to use. Of course, you can also connect it to a mobile phone or computer to perform visual operations to complete the required work. The recording effect is very good, the sound is clear and the noise is very small. According to the manual, the optimal recording distance is 6 meters. Maybe you can try recording at a longer distance to find your own limit as a flexibility in use. Accessories include headphones, Type-C USB conversion cable, USB female connector to Type-C, USB female connector to Iphone, and a small hanging rope loop. There should be as much as there should be. In short, it is a product that I think is very practical. It can also be used as a flash drive. It can be said that it is a good thing for two purposes.",5,Michylol,B0D5Z333HL,2024-07-14

Losing an unsecured earbud while walking or shopping can be annoying and costly. These GNMN G17 arrived securely boxed pre-charged and ready to use. Included in the package are the earbuds in a black charging case approximately 2 inches wide and less than 4 inches long. They come with a 12-inch USB-C cord for charging, two additional ear tips and a user manual. The user manual has customer service information including a WHATSAPP phone number, web address and an email address. The user manual instructions are simple and so is pairing. There is also instructions in the manual on how to answer and end a call. The earbuds indicate which is for the left and right ears on the case as well as on the earbud. Don’t forget to remove the blue protective film. There is an LED power display on the case showing the percentage of charge. They fit securely over your ear and the bud inside to your desired comfort. They are comfortable for my ears, and I’m not worried about losing an earbud by it falling out of my ear. I am very surprised at the sound and bass quality. The range outside and indoors is good if you walk away from the device you’re paired to, before it unpairs. These earbuds also operate Mono Mode where you can leave one earbud in the charging case and wear the other and they still function properly. These connect/pair very easily with my Android phone or my apple I-Pad. The earbuds automatically pair with the last device used. I am pleased with the longevity of the charge. You can also charge these on a charging pad. I have previously purchased SEVERAL different brands of earbuds and headphones from Bose, AKG, BEATS etc; these are one of my favorite pairs of earbuds along with the GNMN V7, and I plan to use them for a long time to come. I recommend these earbuds.",5,Kathy W,B0D97F6FP6,2023-06-13
938,RI3BD0G9P3LMN,Excellent Choice and Value,"I had the GNMN V7 earbuds for nearly a year but then heard about this new version, these G17s. I was happy with the sound of the original V7s but did not like the lack of an actual button for pause, play, answer a call, etc. I gave up trying to control the old ones.  This new version has a button and I appreciate the improvement. The sound is improved as well, but more noticeable in the lower range. I really like the richness of the sound and their volume.  As with the previous version, I really like that they stay in place with the over-the-ear clip. I run, cycle, and workout with these and they stay in place well. I only wear one when running or cycling, though, because they do block other sounds well and I prefer to hear cars coming from behind me. This new version is a little more angled than the old version, so it takes a little more to get them in place but it’s just something I’ll get used to and again it helps them stay solidly in place.  Battery life is great, as with the previous version. I usually run or cycle for around an hour and wear these while playing podcasts or stream music the entire time. When I’m home I place them in the case to charge them and they’re ready to go for my next workout. I can get several runs/cycles/workouts before needing to charge the case. The other day I was on hold for 2 hours with the IRS using these and never even heard the ‘battery low’ warning on the single charge for a single earbud.  The case is sleek and smooth and I like that the USB charging cable now connects at the back of the case rather than the side like with the old version.  Bluetooth connectivity is simple and reliable. I love that I can use one, add the second, and then put one back with no interruptions in sound. Also, since they can connect independently, you could connect one to a phone and the other to a different phone if you need to listen to 2 different things, or share the second one with a running partner who wants to listen to his/her own music.  I definitely consider these a great value because of the rich sound, long battery life, ease of use, and all of the features you get for the price. I don’t think you can go wrong with these.",5,James Spann,B0D97F6FP6,2023-04-26

941,R21ZZE0DLL07QG,Best headphones you will find at this price,"DESIGN: I’ll start with the thing that I liked the most, the design of the G17 headphones. The design of these headphones is truly superb, the designers know what the real issues really are with other most expensive headphones (yes, I’m about to throw shade to some famous headphones). I regret a lot buying airpods, I spent well over $100 and could never use them since they were always falling from my ears. I bought them for the gym and never used them, totally money wasted. Is outstanding how these cheap headphones make the airpods look so bad. The lightweight design and the adjustable hooks ensures the G17 headphones stay in place even during intense workout, they are perfect to use during any active exercise. Trust me, I tested these headphones by playing basketball with them on, never dropped. Additionally, the case that keeps and charges the earbuds is well made. It has a tough and minimalist design making it very easy to store in your person so that you can take them anywhere with you without taking much space. The case also has a great individual displays that lets you know the remaining charge percentage. The case is easy to charge with a very common USB-C cable connection (a very short cable is included).  QUALITY: For the quality of the headphones, I can say that they feel more expensive than the actual price of the product. The sound quality is excellent (I could finally understand what my wife is saying through her extremely cheap phone), and the volume is very dynamic (actually, they can get really loud). To change the volume, is as simple as holding the button on one earbud to turn the volume up while other side turns the volume down. There’s also the option to pause and change the song, they are really easy to use once you get use to them.  CONNECTIVITY: The connection to my iPhone 13 and iPad went smoothly and super easy. Another thing that I liked about this headphone, over the previous one that I had at this price, is that the connection remained stable the entire time I was using them. The old one used to disconnect every 5min whenever I put the phone on my pocket.  I will finish this review by saying that the only thing I would change from these headphones is that I which I would’ve got them earlier. It would have saved me a lot of money and headaches.",5,yamil,B0D97F6FP6,2023-05-13
942,R83TGHN6KRLSW,Excellent Quality Headphones at a Great Price,"I purchased this upgraded product to use for Water Aerobics and Water Zumba.  I listen to different genres of music and sometimes TV and/or movies over the course of the week.  I previously used the V7 version and this version is  far improved in so many ways.  Headphone and Charging base quality:  The headphones, base, and charging cable are all very high quality commensurate with the quality of the V7 version.  Fit:  These headphones have an angle to them that’s has  a far better fit in the ear and around the ear than the V7 and I never feel like they are going to fall out of my ears.  Connectivity:  Connecting and pairing for the first time and every time after that is intuitive and effortless.  Battery Life:  I have been very impressed with the battery life of both the headphones and the charging base.  While I never had issues with the previous version, the battery life on these is longer.  Charging is easy and quick.  Volume and other controls:  The new technology with the raised buttons on these headphones is much improved over the previous version.  The user has much more control over the functions.  With Previous V7 version just touching the headphone to adjust the fit in the ear would increase or lower volume.  This version is easy to navigate all the controls by pressing the buttons.  Sound Quality:  The V7 version had pretty good sound quality with slightly more treble, this new version is a higher quality sound with a little more bass.  Both are good but I prefer the fullness of sound with this newer version.  I also find when listening to TV or movies that the voice quality is clearer and easier to understand.  I highly recommend this product!",5,KaT,B0D97F6FP6,2023-06-19
943,R3U07707SHH134,GNMN does it again,"This is the second pair of earbuds I purchased from GNMN.  I own a pair of V7 earbuds that are my ""go to"" earbuds when I exercise.  They are a work horse.  But I noticed GNMN came out with an updated and improved earbuds the G17.  Since I liked the other model so well, and at such a reasonable price point, I decided to get a pair of these.  The G17 had to win me over because I loved the V7 so much.  Long story short, the G17 came out on top.  Three things I look for in an earbud is comfort and security; sound quality and connectivity.  Comfort and security - Can I wear them 1 hour and will they stay in my ears while I work out?  I have a whole drawer full on earbuds that didn't make that grade.  The G17 hook around your ear and keep the earbud in your ear which helps cancel out all the distracting gym noises (like the guy talking on his cell phone right next to you!!!) Plus you don't even know they are there due to their comfort.  (Side note - they come with different size ear pieces to custom fit your ear.)  Sound quality - Well I also own a pair of Bose noise cancelling earbuds.  Does the G17 sound as good?  No, but it is very close.  The Bose base is a little stronger but they are also 10 more expensive.  Not worth the price difference in my mind.  Plus my Bose earbuds keep falling out of my ear, so they fail the comfort and security test.  The sound of the G17 is very clear.  I listened to a live concert and I thought I was there it was so clear.  Very impressed.  Connectivity -  I give the G17 top ratings this this category.  In my drawer of discarded earbuds, one of the common problems I had with them is they didn't connect well with each other and it was hard or impossible to easily switch devices connected to them.  Just like the V7, the G17 worked perfectly.  Just take them out of the case and they automatically connect to each other.  First time out of the box, they automatically go into pairing mode and I was able to connect to my iPad with no problem.  I wanted to see how easy it would be to connect to my Android phone, so I turned off the Bluetooth on my iPad and turned on the Bluetooth on my phone and immediately the G17 appeared.  All I had to do was pair the earbuds to my phone and I was connected.  Next time out of the charging case, they automatically connect to the last device you have paired with them (in this case my phone).  The case is a little bigger than the V7 but very handy.  I like the digital screen which shows the battery charge of the case and it shows if it is charging the earbuds.  Glad I made the purchase.  My V7 is taking a back seat to the G17, but it is NOT going into my discard drawer.  They are just to good.",5,Jon of Knoxville TN,B0D97F6FP6,2023-06-06

949,R19FDKGBVWX83B,An Awesome Movie Looks Even Better on Blu-ray!,"The movies I currently have on Blu-ray are Iron Man, Kill Bill, The Dark Knight, and Wall-E, and Kill Bill is the second best in video quality on the list, second only to Wall-E.  Kill Bill was my first Blu-ray purchase (which is funny because the first DVD I bought was my favorite movie at the time, The Matrix, and Kill Bill is my new favorite movie), and I am really impressed with it. Aside from the lack of special features, it's just incredible. The video transfer is a lot better than what the DVDs were at an output of 1080p and the audio is crystal clear at uncompressed, lossless PCM 5.1. I doubled over with shock when I saw the opening scene of the Vernita Green chapter because of how wonderfully vibrant the colors are. It really made me feel like I was back in the theater again, even though my TV is only 40"". If you love Kill Bill, then this is pretty much a must-own. While I don't think you should dump all your DVDs for Blu-ray discs, you should know that there's an appreciable difference in quality if you have the TV for it and the visual qualities of the movie are Blu-ray worthy (like Kill Bill). I know that not many people think there's a difference, but you'd be amazed how quickly you turn into a videophile when you see a movie like this in Blu-ray.  As for the movie itself: the only Tarantino movie better than Kill Bill is Pulp Fiction, but I prefer Kill Bill because it has such an awesome mix of heartfelt moments, great music, over-the-top action scenes, and memorable dialogue. You have to go into Vol. 1 expecting lots of blood and unnecessary violence and appreciate that it's a homage. Vol. 1 is just a lot of fun and the cinematography is always spot-on. Then Vol. 2 comes around and brings you more of the story you may have thought was missing along with a lot of smart lines and even more interesting characters than the first. The two together are a symphony of what I love about cinema. I know that few people share my love of this movie, but I think that it's a movie worth seeing at least once, if not several times.",5,Elton Pinto,B0D9238TCL,2009-02-09
950,R2P2NMCP3AZIUU,FLAWLESS ! An Artist @ The Peak of His Powers,"This album is a bona fide masterpiece !!! Cave produced a set here that is alternately (and sometimes simultaneously) touching, frightening, seductive and hilarious. Lyrically and musically every note and syllable is dead on the money. This is the penultimate Bad Seeds lineup in that (in the studio anyway as other combinations of players have done so as well live) every member best contributes in a meaningful way to interpreting these brilliant songs. Whether it be delicately finessing a section or pummeling it, Cave seems to conduct the unit as though wielding sledge hammer like a feather. The instrumentation fits the mood(s) perfectly and the band never does more or less with it than is necessary to support the melody. If they had only given us ""Do You Love Me?"", ""Nobody's Baby Now"" and the scintillating, superb ""Red Right Hand"" it would have been more than sufficient but the remaining tracks are excellent as well. The songs are catchy without being commercial, memorable without repetition (except when deliberately employed to illicit tension/discomfort) and emotional without being maudlin. Draped in both ornate and spare arrangements each is a pleasure for the ears. For those of you unfamiliar this is the best place to start when exploring the spectacular and timeless catalog Cave has gifted us. Highly recommended for fans of Leonard Cohen, SWANS, Tindersticks, Cathal Coughlin, Brendan Perry, Pulp and even Scott Walker.",5,Chris,B0D9238TCL,2021-02-22
951,RT0GGLIEVQQRD,Great Movie-Box Set is ok,"Quentin Tarantino is arguably the best film-maker of his generation. His ability and passion to tell stories through film is second to none. ""Kill Bill"" bears witness to Tarantino's love of film by referencing a variety of genres such as blacksploitation, marital arts, anime, spaghetti westerns, and superhero movies. Some might find it easy to dismiss him as merely a movie fan who makes movies about other movies. I argue that he's far more creative than that. He draws upon these genres for inspiration and creates stories that are fresh, intelligently written, and compelling to watch. For example, in the third act of volume 2, Bill, played by the late David Carradine, shoots [Uma Thurman's character] with a dart filled with truth serum forcing her to answer his many questions. While waiting for the serum to take effect, Bill monologues about his fascination with comic books and, in particular, superhero mythology. ""The point emerges"" as Bill compares [Uma Thurman's character's] alter-ego, Arlene Plympton, with Superman's alter-ego, Clark Kent. No one but Tarantino could reference comic books in a film and make the dialogue sound so interesting.  In the realm of cinematography, he ""pulls out all the stops"" using a variety of camera techniques like split-screens, long-shots, and fast close-ups on the eyes. Some of these techniques can be traced backed to Martin Scorsese, one of his biggest influences. Of course, do I even need to mention the music? I believe I can best describe the selection as cooler than Dante's ninth level of hell. ""Kill Bill"", while packed with dozens of exciting ideas, can be enjoyed simply as fun movie viewing which, in my opinion, is a trademark of an excellent director.  The Box Set isn't anything extraordinary. Based on my own copy, all that I can determine is that the Box Set contains the regular DVDs............................. in a display box. Unless you are obsessive over display boxes, you could do just as well to buy the two movies separately either online or at your local movie retail store. I personally enjoy the DVD extras but don't be deceived. The Box Set doesn't contain any additional DVD extras.",5,J. J. Nester,B0D9238TCL,2010-02-05
952,R2XOUL4NRL8US0,Great movie but no subtitles??,"I purchased this movie knowing that it is a classic and I just wanted to have it for my personal collection. Unfortunately, many of the reviews on amazon were from many many years ago close to when blue ray was still new. I wanted to leave a review simply so others in my position can get some updated info on it.  Firstly, the movie only has one disc and the disc menu has both movies for you to select once you get to the menu screen. No problem with this at all and it works great. If you are getting this movie you likely already have seen both movies and would also just like to have it on your shelf. The only real complaint I have with this collection is that it had no support for subtitles anywhere which I thought was pretty crazy not to be included.  Outside of that the movie plays the same as the originals and many reviews were spot on. You can definitely tell its an older blue ray title but it still plays great nontheless. A great classic and a must have on your shelf!",4,Albert Green,B0D9238TCL,2023-02-23

954,R3E9MH85M4TH5F,I'm am gonna kill Bill...,"Kill Bill Volume 1 (5 stars out of 5) This film has become an all-time favorite of mine.  The story is great, and told in a very interesting way.  The characters are great; acting and writing are smashing.  There are a lot of awesome fight scenes.  It is very bloody, but in a stylish way (the sqeamish will hate this).  And even when there is no fighting, it's still a vivid, interesting film.  Altogether, it's awesome.  Kill Bill Volume 2 (5 stars out of 5) Completing the story and filling in a lot of necessary gaps, this second part of the duology is longer and more dialogue-driven, and with less action (and less blood).  Still, it's interesting.  The characters are still great, the writing/acting is great, and the visual style is still good.  It's practically a necessity after watching the first part.  And it has a jolly good ending.  Both films are very sublime and excellent, and highly reccomended to anybody who likes action and doesn't mind some blood.  The Blu-Rays are of great quality, especially for the second film.  The sound quality is great; the dialogue is clear and well-balanced.  Each movie has a 20-minute making-of featurette.  Volume 1 has a musical performance and a bunch of trailers, and volume 2 has a deleted scene and a musical performance.  Whether or not it is worthy of replacing the DVD is entirely up to you.  I liked the movies enough to go for it, and at the very least, I am pleased with the picture/sound quality.  I'll still want to grab the ""Whole Bloody Affair"" edition (you know, unrated director's cut with shedloads of special features and other crud) whenever it comes out, but considering that it never existed in the first place, I am not one to complain.  Heck, I might even keep this copy, so I have the theatrical cut.  Altogether, I don't agree with the others who complain.  It's still a good movie, and it's of good quality.",5,AMP,B0D9238TCL,2008-09-12
955,R1MVXYKMOQYH5M,"There is something for everyone in ""Kill Bill""","I first heard about this movie several years ago when it was in theaters, but I did not know what it was about until I watched it on TV. This extremely action-packed martial arts flick, directed by Quentin Tarantino, centers on a bride and professional assassin, (played by Uma Thurman), who seeks revenge after Bill, her former martial arts master and boss (played by David Carradine) turns on her and attempts to kill her at her wedding. This movie has something for everyone---the martial arts action of any number of Jackie Chan movies, the covert operations of a James Bond movie, the swashbuckling sword fights found in movies like “Zorro,” “Three Musketeers,” or “The Count of Monte Cristo,” and, in the case of part 2, and the domesticity of any number of romance movies or soap operas. It even has a bit of Anime in part 1, and even dialogue in Japanese and Chinese for those who are into foreign films and the “Kill Bill” franchise has an awesome soundtrack. Not only that, but as a Flamenco fan, I was both pleased and surprised to discover that the soundtrack features music by the famous Spanish gypsy Flamenco duo, Lole y Manuel, which was the absolute icing on the cake. What was funny about that, though, was that the scenes in which Lole y Manuel’s music was used as the soundtrack actually took place in Mexico. This film is probably one of the best martial arts/action movies I have ever seen.",5,D. Nykiel,B0D9238TCL,2018-03-12
956,RCMUUMRB538IE,I was expecting a bit more in Blu-Ray,"Right off the bat, I'll start by saying that Amazon chose to be ""less than honest"" about this set when I bought it. They showed it as ""NC-17"", and said they ""couldn't verify my information"" when I submitted a correction after having received ""R"" versions.  That said, this set is decent, though I really expected a lot more from Blu-Ray.  The video transfer is incredibly sharp, albeit somewhat oversaturated... so you might want to back down the color on your display. Some will probably say that the saturation is intentional, but having seen this in the theater and on DVD, I'm going to go ahead and disagree.  As far as audio goes, Buena Vista was nice enough to give us uncompressed 5.1, though I'm incredibly disappointed that there was no DTS track, as it was indeed available when this movie was in theaters (so it's not like there would have been a ton of work involved in providing it, or that there wasn't enough space on the disc for it). That said, the uncompressed audio is better than average, though, much like the color, I'm reasonably sure an audio engineer was given instructions along the lines of ""Make it thump more! This is Blu-Ray!"", resulting in some unbalanced effects.  Don't buy this set if you're looking for extras. There really aren't any. You get a couple of songs by the 5,6,7,8's (the band playing at Charlie Brown's place) and some 480p trailers for other Tarantino movies.  If you already own the DVD set and have a decent upscaling DVD player, this Blu-Ray set isn't going to offer you very much more than you already have. But at the price Amazon's offering the set at, it isn't like you're getting ripped off. If you don't have these discs on DVD already, it's probably worth the extra money to get the Blu-Ray discs.",4,Kevin Nicholls,B0D9238TCL,2008-09-22
970,RP5AE9HYC6ZM9,Impressive wireless bluetooth,"I recently tried out these Bluetooth wireless earbuds, and I must say, the connectivity is a breeze. Pairing them with my device was quick and hassle-free. The sound quality is impressive – pure and clear, providing an immersive audio experience.  Battery life is a strong suit; these earbuds hold a charge well and last surprisingly long. I've been using them throughout the day without worrying about running out of power.  When it comes to calls, the clarity is excellent. I've had conversations without any distortion or background noise, making them reliable for both music and calls.  The sleek design and comfortable fit enhance the overall experience, making them suitable for long periods of use. The touch controls are responsive, adding to the user-friendly design.  In terms of portability, the compact charging case is convenient for on-the-go use. It's a great value for the price, and based on my experience, I would definitely recommend these Bluetooth earbuds for anyone in need of reliable and high-quality audio.",5,Mohammed Awal,B0D7ZQ1ZLF,2024-02-26
971,R242XSZLM45ZJG,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR THE PRICE,"Just received today and tested, Honestly it much better than the more expensive earbuds I bought. The ones I bought have only one ear size and I couldn't keep them in because they were too big. This earbuds have 3 interchangeable sizes to choose. The design is very comfortable, lightweight and ergonomic, fits well for ears. If you fit the earphones tightly in your ears, you can enjoy excellent quality bass sound, which allows you to reduce outside noise. Microphone is very good too, when I make a call, the other person hear me strong and clear Battery life is amazing and the battery charge is very fast too, battery life indicator is very useful, show it the battery charge percentage, this is really excellent because allows me to know how much charge I have. In addition to that, it has two charging systems: Type-C charging and Wireless Charging. Bluetooth connection is very easy and quickly, GNMN M7 has many functions, which makes it more efficient like answer call, end call, reject call, next track, previous track, play or pause, volume up, volume down for song or videos YouTube, another good function is when you put it in your ears, audio system tells you “Power on, connected” The headphones have a good range, between my devices and the headphones, I have tested it up to 5 meters away. Material quality is very resistant, I have dropped many times and headphones are ok. I can use only the right headphone on and it works without the need to have both in my ears, so my left ear can be free to be aware of my surroundings I have connected it to many devices such as my iPhone, Apple TV, Android phone and on my Windows 11 Laptop and it has been compatible with all of them, without any problem, pairing was quickly. My advice, if you are looking for quality, comfort and good price this is the best choice that I have found and used.",5,Harry Tan,B0D7ZQ1ZLF,2023-08-24
972,R15Y2R3A93JHFV,Fantastic Sound Quality,"The GNMN True Wireless Earbuds are a great choice for anyone looking for stellar sound quality at a reasonable price. These earbuds offer a rich sound when listening to music and podcasts and the design is sleek and compact.  The battery life is very impressive.  I can use them for long periods without the need for frequent recharging, which is extremely convenient and allows me to leave the in the car for long periods.  I also appreciate the fact the case shows the charging status so there is no need to hold the case close to phone and open the lid.  The fit is comfortable they are pretty stable although I did need to change the eartip cover to a smaller one, but that was no problem as they come with three options.  I would say one  drawback for me was they did not stay in my ears well at the gym, but i find most earbuds (even the high end ones) do not.  I primarily use another brand with earhooks . . . but believe me, the sound quality is far better from the GNMN M7s then the sport earbuds I recently purchased.  The touch controls for calls and music work nicely, allowing for easy adjustments to the volume, skipping music tracks, or answering calls with one or two taps. The Bluetooth 5.0 provides for seamless connectivity and they paired easily with my iPhone.  I would highly recommend these earbuds to anyone looking for a reasonably priced great sounding earbud.  You definitely can't go wrong with these  . .  . they would make a great gift or stocking stuffer for anyone, especially that teen who may be inclined to lose small items.",5,HarleyGirl,B0D7ZQ1ZLF,2023-11-01
973,R2Y1PHXYME9FNJ,Great for the price,"I gave these headphones a chance since they weren’t very expensive and I am glad I did.  I am really happy with the sound quality and the battery life on such an affordable set.  They come with a nice charging case that has charged the actual headphones multiple times without me recharging the case.  They connect to my phone really fast and easy and have a surprisingly far range that can still connect even if I set my phone down to walk around.  They fit really well in my ear and haven’t had problems with them falling out. I like the black color and the case shows how charged the case is as well as each headphone so I know when I am getting close to needing to charge them again.  Small enough set that they fit well in my pocket or my bag which I am happy with.  I mostly listen to podcasts and they all sound very clear but have tested out some different style music and the sound range holds up well.  Overall I would recommend them to friends, good price, happy with the quality, seems like they will hold up. Can’t go wrong with some good cheap headphones.",5,Ray Schrand Jr,B0D7ZQ1ZLF,2024-03-04
974,R2FOINBKS1EDG,Reliable and Budget-Friendly: Earbuds That Deliver on Comfort and Battery Life,"These wireless earbuds are a practical choice for those who prioritize comfort, battery life, and ease of use without breaking the bank. When it comes to comfort, they fit snugly in the ears, providing a secure feel even during more vigorous activities like running or working out. There's no constant need to adjust them or push them back into the ear canal, which is a common issue with some other brands.  Battery life is another strong suit. While not extraordinary, it's more than sufficient for daily use, whether you're commuting, working out, or just lounging around. You won't find yourself constantly reaching for the charger, which is a convenience that should not be underestimated.  Sound quality is good, though not exceptional. It provides a balanced audio experience that should satisfy most users. The bass is present but not overwhelming, and the highs are clear without being piercing. It's a sound profile that works well for a variety of music genres as well as podcasts and phone calls.  Pairing the earbuds with an iPhone is a straightforward process. There are no complicated steps or sequences to follow. Once paired, the connection remains stable, without the frequent dropouts that plague some other wireless options. This reliability in connection is something that can often be overlooked but is crucial for a seamless listening experience.  As for the price, it's competitive. You're getting a well-rounded product that performs reliably in key areas without costing as much as premium models. While they may lack some of the advanced features found in higher-end earbuds, such as active noise cancellation or customizable sound profiles, what they do offer is executed well.  In summary, these earbuds are a sensible choice for those who want a reliable, comfortable, and straightforward audio solution. They won't revolutionize your listening experience, but they will perform consistently well in the areas that matter most: comfort, battery life, sound quality, and ease of use. For the price, they offer good value and are worth considering for everyday use.",5,Brent,B0D7ZQ1ZLF,2023-08-28
975,R3GKUMXKGBRR05,Great value Earbuds,"These Earbuds are a great product and great value.  I have used a lot of earbuds from various manufacturers in the past and these surpass all of them. Look:  They are cool and sleek looking in my ears. Fit:  I have had a lot of problems with fit before, but not with these.  Perfect fit and   Comfortable to wear. Connection:  They connect quickly to devices quickly via Bluetooth.  They both stay connected all the   time. Useability:  I work out quite a bit and have not had any issues with sweat or having the earbuds loosen   or drop out of my ears. Charging:  It can be charged via a USB-C or one of those wireless charging pads.  The charging box   also has a handy readout of charge levels. Sound Quality:  Volume is adjustable and sound quality is excellent for music and spoken word.  Controls:  Touch controls(taps and holds) are easy and intuitive to do things like adjust volume,   pause/play content, and skip songs.  Overall:  I am really pleased with this purchase.",5,Jerseyboba,B0D7ZQ1ZLF,2023-11-10
976,R135FP8DMXMD0U,Much better than expected.,"I purchased the GNMN M7 wireless earbuds without knowing very well how I would enjoy the sound. I have a pair of Apple AirPods Pro which I received when I received my iPad Pro for free from my university.  I’m not the biggest fan of either the “stick-type” air pods or the type of earbuds that go into your ear canal. I prefer the earbuds with an ear hook as any other type tends to fall out of my ears and I can never get a perfect fit.  Since I have both the GNMN M7 earbuds and the AirPods Pro, I decided to spend a few hours interchanging both based on the music I was listening to through the Amazon Music app. I also completed some phone calls which each one. What stood out to me first was how crisp and rich the sound was from the GNMN M7 earbuds. I didn’t expect the type of clarity and was pleasantly surprised when I first put them in my ears. The one difference that I noticed is that the bass was not as overwhelming as it is with the AirPods Pro. I’m not big on booming bass. It’s just my preference, and it’s probably also why I was never a fan of my son’s Beats wireless earbuds. For me, excessive bass ruins the music. I prefer to adjust the equalizer in the app I’m using when I want bass-heavy music. It’s a lot simpler than having to constantly adjust the bass in songs.  I also discovered that for whatever reason, the M7s didn’t seem as uncomfortable to me as the AirPods. There is a very slight difference in angle that can be seen from the screenshot, which I think makes the difference for me. It doesn’t seem to be much, but depending on an individual’s ear canal that slight angle can be the difference between a comfortable fit and an uncomfortable fit. The M7s were so clear and comfortable that I wore them for close to 2 hours before I even realized that I had them in my ears.  As far as I could tell, (with the exception of the over-emphasized bass of the AirPods) there was practically no difference between the M7s and the AirPods sound-wise. On paper, the AirPods have active noise cancellation. However, I’m not a very big fan of this with earbuds. The change in frequency when using noise cancellation with earbuds usually makes me feel a little queasy. I prefer the noise cancellation through my over-the-ear headphones on my Bose QC 35. And to be honest, I only use that on planes, or when I’m studying in a library. I like being able to hear a few sounds around me. You never know when hearing sounds around you will really matter.  I detected absolutely no difference in phone calls. I was able to hear the user clearly on both models of earbuds, and my voice was heard clearly on the other end with no static or dropped sounds.  The M7s synced very easily with my phone. There was no pairing button to press. All I had to do was have my phone scan Bluetooth devices, and there was “M7”, waiting to be paired. It really is that effortless. The M7s come with three different sizes of ear tips and a USB-C charging cable. I was also pleasantly surprised to discover that the case works with my wireless charger. In addition, one huge advantage that the M7 charging case has over the AirPod case is that the M7s have an LED display on the charging case that tells you what percent the charge is at. The AirPods have no such display. It is more of a guessing game. To be honest, since I wasn’t the biggest fan of the AirPods “stick-format”, the most I’ve used them have been over the past couple of days. In regards to the price-to-performance ratio, they’ve failed to impress.  The biggest clincher, and the one that stands out the most to me, is that in most markets, the M7s are practically $150 or more, cheaper than the AirPods. In my opinion, paying over $100 for ANY brand of earbuds is one of the biggest tech rip-offs going right now. Who knew that I could get the exact same sound from a $30 pair of GNMN M7 wireless earbuds as I do from the AirPods?  I highly recommend the M7s for the excellent sound quality, the comfort, and the price. For such a good pair of earbuds, this is an incredible deal.",5,Derek880,B0D7ZQ1ZLF,2023-08-27

978,R2E3WJCRNBJM6J,The sound!!!!,I read all the reviews regarding these wireless earbuds they all had nothing but good things to say about them. So I said “what the heck” if all these people love them then it’s a win! And the price was a win as well! I ordered them today paid $2.99 for same day delivery and just got them they paired extremely well with my iPhone 15 with no issue. I went to Amazon music and play a song for about 2 minutes and I was blown away at how good they sound. The size is perfect to throw inside my crossbody bag and my makeup bag. I live for a good black accessory and these didn’t disappoint. I haven’t made a call due to it’s late but I will in the morning I work for a law firm and I make lots of calls to courts. So I hope the sound for the calls both in and out going calls is a clear and crisp as the music sounded. If you looking for a good pair of wireless earbuds look no far! This is the correct spot to order from you will not be disappointed! Love them! Glad I purchased them! May need to get a back up cause once my daughter sees them I’ll never see them again ??,5,Trissa,B0D7ZQ1ZLF,2024-07-15
979,R1PW7QVQKFT7ID,Simple to use!!,"These are so easy to use! I have tried several pair of wireless earbuds. I have often found them to be confusing! I appreciate the clearly worded User Manual that comes with these earbuds.  I love that the earbuds speak “Connected” when the earbuds are connected to my phone—and  “Disconnected” and “Pairing” at the appropriated times.  I love that I can control the volume with the earbuds. (Some other earbuds that I have tried have not had that capability—You would have to use the volume on your device.) You can also Play or Pause music or skip to the next or previous track using taps on these earbuds. I love that is has the prompt sound (musical note) “Du” when the volume reaches minimum or maximum levels. I love that the spot on the earbuds that you are to tap or press is clearly pictured in the manual AND that it is actually easy to touch/ press. (Some others I have had have been super picky about touching a seemingly tiny spot very specifically or lightly. Or others have a button that seems to need to be pressed rather hard.) Before using these earbuds, I thought that I would not like that I have to tap twice to answer or end a call—I wanted to tap only once. But, since using it, I find that I quite enjoy this feature. Tapping only once can sometimes be too sensitive. Interestingly, there is no command on these earbuds that responds to only tapping once.. .  These are also simple to charge, and hold a charge for a reasonably long length of time. The case is a handy, sleek design with a digital display that the buds are being charged and what percent charged they are. They come with multiple eartips, so you are likely to have the correct fit for you. The sound goes nice and loud and includes instructions to go even louder. I know noise cancellation is important to many—that is a thing for these buds as well. Again, overall, these wireless earbuds are very simple to use. They have many great features that you are looking for! They are a very good, affordable buy.",5,Briansangel,B0D7ZQ1ZLF,2024-03-30
982,R31KCVR9UGIJ9Y,Does Not Work With All Bands,"(Pic shows final result after modification)  The good:  The bumper fits the watch perfectly, with precision cutouts.  Works perfectly with the included screen protectors, which when combined provide complete protection.  They also look as good as plastic can look.  The bad:  The areas that meet together with the watch band extend slightly past the watch.  This caused me to be unable to use the bumper with the watch bands I purchased, as shown.  I ended up using a dremel to file down the bumper in the four parts shown.  The plastic held up without issue while using the tool on the lowest setting and it appears that the plastic is a solid color, not painted, so it still looks good once I finished filing and buffing it out.  Conclusion:  Consider that there will need to be an extra two millimeters between the edge of the watch and band if you use this product unless you don't mind filing it down to fit.  Otherwise, this is a good value for the quality and number of pieces included.",4,Jamie,B0D73N1WKT,2022-06-26
983,RP3ZRCM0M6CLO,This watch case looks great - not cheap!,"I really was impressed when I rec'd the product. The fit is perfect for the new Samsung Watch 4 (if you order the correct size) and the matte finish is very rich looking. No way you can does it look like and add on. I ordered a 2 pack by a different maker and they just looked like cheap plastic. There was even a seam from the mold.  There is a video up with the product info that shows exactly how to install the screen protector then case. It was all very easy, and I can pop off the case and switch  without removing the glass. I read other people saying that the cases with built in tempered glass can trap water.  I really wish there was an option to buy all 7 colors rather than 2 sets of 5. The reason I bought the 2 pack was to get the rose gold in addition to the blue and green. BTW - the green I received is the dark forest green that is pictured. Someone got a paler green that I would like to have as well. Since the watch just hit the market, I'm sure there will be more choices, but I will try to stick with the Cuteey brand since I know the quality to expect.",5,Angell 1,B0D73N1WKT,2021-10-17

I have to move it around to get some channels, so it's kind of annoying. For about $20 on Prime day, I figured I'd upgrade it to this one based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews and I'm so glad I did. After plugging both the USB plug and the antenna into my TV, I was missing some channels, but I did a fresh autosearch on my LG TV and after the new search, the few local channels that didn't come across before were now crystal clear in digital HD! I left it in the ""far mode"" on the switch.  I like that this has mounting double sided tape discs and the instructions were quick and easy to follow. I mean, there's not much to it. Just plug it in and scan your channels to start enjoying your free to air live TV. It worked for me just like so many others.

1011,R15KYMBQU1HLZL,"Yes, it can brainwash your child (making this grandfather retire his case)","Idina Menzel gave concerts in Chicago (Ravinia) and Milwaukee (Performing Arts Center), shortly before the appearance of &#34;Frozen.&#34;  I was given a front-row ticket to the Milwaukee concert and was struck, above all, by the numerous young people (college age and slightly older) who were obviously familiar with practically every sung word, eagerly joining Menzel on stage upon being invited to perform numbers from recent Broadway musicals (&#34;Rent,&#34; &#34;Wicked&#34;).  As a jazz fan (and musician) I must admit the music wasn't my &#34;bag&#34; (with the exception of &#34;Avenue Q,&#34; which knocked me out).  To my ears, most popular songs of the past 50 years sounds infinitely inferior to the music of Jerome Kern (&#34;Showboat&#34;), Rodgers and Hammerstein (&#34;Oklahoma&#34;), Gershwin (&#34;Porgy and Bess), Rodgers and Hart (&#34;On Your Toes&#34;), Cole Porter (&#34;Anything Goes&#34;), Bernstein and Sondheim (&#34;West Side Story&#34;)--in terms of structural integrity, melodic inventiveness, lyric wit, and range and depth of emotional expression (perhaps the reason these are the songs that constitute the library that has come to be known as &#34;The Great American Songbook&#34;).  In any case, my opinions were rendered meaningless by the profound effect this movie had on my 3-year-old grand-daughter.  Although I didn't observe much of a response from her at the theater (either during or immediately following the movie), a mere 3 months later she's singing every single note, every word of the score of &#34;Frozen&#34; (I couldn't even tell you the name of the composer-lyricist). Granted, in that time she's had a birthday, but I'm no less impressed.  And it's quite apparent that this &#34;blockbuster&#34; out of the Disney studios is having a similar impact on thousands of other children--of all ages.  The tunes from &#34;Frozen&#34; and, for that matter, most other recent musicals, don't lend themselves to jazz improvisation, but neither does much operatic music.  Only the passage of time will tell us whether this music will endure like Kern's &#34;All the Things You Are&#34; or Johnny Greene's &#34;Body and Soul&#34; or Harold Arlen's &#34;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&#34; (to name just a few examples of &#34;classic&#34; American tunes that are part of an inarguable &#34;canon&#34; of American popular song).  But I'll be far more hesitant about criticizing it.  And even if it eventually sinks into the oblivion of so much pop emphemera, a musical like &#34;Frozen&#34; leads in a musical direction that's considerably more professional and sophisticated than the folk, rock and country music (mostly by guitar-playing singer-songwriters) that has dominated American popular music since the 1960s.  Come to think of it, Menzel exhibited a &#34;Broadway voice&#34; that was not all that unlike Ethel Merman's (minus the vibrato--Ethel was the favorite of the early great composers because of her power and elocution, both essential to Broadway shows before the development of the microphone, which was not even a factor in vocal performances until the late 1920s and the emergence of the creative genius who knew to use it-- Bing Crosby).  Near the beginning of practically any course that I teach--literature, music, and film--I warn my youthful troops (learning is a risky adventure) that they all possess a bias against anything that is perceived as &#34;old,&#34; &#34;past,&#34; &#34;before their time&#34; and that one of their greatest challenges will be to surmount their pre-existing bias in favor of the &#34;modern,&#34; or &#34;contempotrary&#34; for education (which means &#34;moving out&#34; of restrictive confines) to occur.  Education is more about covering epochs of &#34;time&#34; (in teaching linguistics, I endeavor to go back some 50 million years!) than vast expanses of &#34;space.&#34;  Traveling--even in outer space--is of great interest and even a potentially transformative experience for some, yet it's extremely limited compared to the traveling in time that is possible only through the study of texts from the past.  In other words, they'd better be prepared to read, and have an open mind to, a lot of &#34;dead white guys&#34; (not excluding some black ones, like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, both of whom produced music that resonates in consciousness with the creative brilliance of a Shakespeare sonnet or a Homeric epic poem).  Already, as a teacher-student, I've no doubt alienated myself from not only some of those &#34;present-bound&#34; youth that occupy my classroom but from of the narrow-minded and rigid Americans on the far right who have condemned &#34;Frozen&#34; as a propaganda piece supporting modern &#34;liberal&#34; notions such as women who can overcome formidable obstacles and attain the kind of powerful automony we like to see in our great national leaders.  We're told that such empowerment of women defies all of the patriarchal examples of the past not to mention the teachings of the Bible and other religious texts.  Moreover, we're told that by showing us two women who are capable of loving, above all, each other, &#34;Frozen&#34; is brainwashing our youth into approving of homosexuals if not becoming one!  Who would have &#34;thunk it&#34;!!  (I confess these ideas never occurred to me until I bagan reading and hearing reports about the controversy stirred up by this movie, which had initially left me largely indifferent and about $50 poorer).  It occurs to me that we can all &#34;learn&#34; from these alarmists as the vert antithesis of a genuine student, with a mind open to learning.  Rather than learning how to interpret a &#34;text&#34; (literary, film, musical, etc.) they're &#34;hardened idealogues&#34; who have become all too well practiced in their habitual litmus tests (i.e. &#34;witch hunts&#34;).  I encourage them all to take a few classes in &#34;higher learning,&#34; for their own good and the communities they attempt to serve.  In the meantime, I'm enjoying my grand-daughter's extended arias-recitatives, lifted from the soundtrack of &#34;Frozen,&#34; and being sung with such joyful abandon and power (&#34;mostly&#34; on pitch) that I can feel my house's foundation moving and witness my cats frozen in trepidation as they cling to their preferred perches in the four-story trees (ordered from Amazon).  It's enough proof for me to conclude my grand-child (who had just recently conquered &#34;the potty&#34;) was, indeed, &#34;liberated,&#34; and at the age of 3!  Who knows where she'll go from here?  I'm simply relieved to know that she won't have limits placed upon her by some perhaps well-intentioned by sadly misinformed hard-liner.  If you wish to learn about music, you might do well to talk to and hang out with a musican. If you want to learn about &#34;morality,&#34; the last person to consult is a &#34;moralist.&#34;",5,Samuel,B0D626HRLD,2014-04-14
1012,R30A9KNU3RNQYV,A series of happy accidents that conspire to make a superb classic,"Like many adults, when I first saw the trailers for this, I was uninspired. Sure, kids will always like it, it's a Disney thing, how bad could it ever be! However, under the helmsmanship of the brilliantly creative John Lasseter, the film was made, remade, then remade again into a beautiful animated story.   I am a writer, and although I know story is always king, films are different than books, and in a film you must have other visual and sound elements that make it gripping and appealing. Having read &#34;The Snow Queen&#34; by HCA, I can see why that tale would be hard to make into a good movie - too dark, too dull, too disconnected from the public watching it. &#34;Frozen&#34; gives us somewhat flawed, human characters that have been SO-O carefully written, and SO-O carefully animated by a team of brilliant animators, that, although they don't look precisely like normal humans, they do come alive with a spirit that touches us all. The story is of two sisters, who grew up close and then get somewhat separated - although you'd have to account for them seeing each other sometimes, since they both know WAY too much about the other not to have seen each other at all for some 15 years. Still, they have always loved each other, and both cherish the value of family (witness the true painful sadness at the loss of their parents).  Yet they have a problem with the oldest child having been born with an incredible power that can create ice and snow from the existing atmosphere, manufacture blizzards, and also create several other things (like dresses, ices skates, and living snowmen) from thin air - all and all an awesome power for someone to have.  Now all of this can certainly be fun, but, like all things of power, especially in the hands of a young child, they can also be dangerous, which is precisely what the magical Trolls tell us early on; this provides the monumental difficulty for the two sisters. Thus, because Elsa is just a kid when she discovers this, she has no real ability to control it. Her father's message of &#34;conceal it, don't feel it&#34; is not at all helpful, since she doesn’t practice how to control her powers for all those successive years of growing up; however, the father’s advice is logical to give his precious daughter, trying to keep her, and all those around her, safe.   When Elsa’s gift is discovered by the community, and she is thought to be a monster - logically enough - she is left with no choice she can think of but to run off and be alone so she won't hurt anyone, and where she can also be herself. There, in the ice and snow wilderness, she discovers all her powers and LETS IT GO! But Anna, who now comes to the crushing realization of what has been happening with her sister all these years, is personally hurt for not understanding before and is still out of a sibling who she loves; and so, she chases after her, picking up the gentlemanly Kristoff and lovable Olaf on the way. The trek Anna and Kristoff make is interesting and truly charming, with some great music and adventure on the way.   But finding Elsa still doesn't make this an easy rescue, for Elsa is still worried about the damage she can cause since, unbeknownst to her, the fear she can't control within her is destructive; in fact, she thinks of it as a curse. Thus, she chases her sister away to try to save her from harm. In the process, she accidentally strikes Anna with her ice-making power again, this time in the heart, harming her. Kristoff realizes it and knows he has to take her to the magical Trolls, which are his family, to save her. However, after some nice Troll music and another group of charming scenes, the Troll king says he cannot save her, cannot thaw her heart, which only an act of true love can do. And here we have the heart of the story, although the writers sort of err, if in a forgivable way, because that “act of true love” is given several times by Kristoff who takes her to find her sister, and later the Trolls, in the first place and then rushes her back to Arendelle to see Hans who will hopefully save her by thawing her heart with a true love’s kiss - but you don't need more of an act of true love than what Kristoff has already done a few times! BUT, they give you one anyway, when Hans tries to kill Elsa, and Anna risks her own life to save the older sister she has always adored.   SO, here we are, with two sisters, each of whom loves the other enough to sacrifice herself for her - Elsa, in her lifelong sacrifice of self-imposed solitude, just to keep her sister safe, and Anna, by putting herself in the way of the sword to save Elsa from being slain. Ultimately, it is the quintessential family message of love and sacrifice that saves the sisters, their family, and the kingdom, since Elsa now realizes that love is the way to control her magical power and be a benefit to her kingdom instead of a dangerous curse. This heavy message, so gleefully done, and so brilliantly animated by characters that come alive right before our eyes, with realistic gestures, movements, and expressions, touches our hearts and are what make this film unmatched by any previous Disney animation. The original story idea? TERRIBLE! The dropping of the &#34;Do you want to build a snowman&#34; song - unforgivably stupid; fortunately Lasseter had the common sense to put it back in. Thus, the film they finished with was a spectacular tale of great music, heartfelt pathos, and visual splendor that they are going to have a difficult time repeating in Frozen 2! I mean, the making of the ice castle scene with Elsa singing “Let It Go” (through Idina Menzel’s spectacular voice) is virtually worth the price of the movie all by itself.   I have one criticism of the marketing of “Frozen” - it is not a story about a young girl searching for her sister trying to restore summer to Arendelle; it IS a story of the Snow Queen, and how Elsa metamorphosizes from a problem child with powerful magic she can’t control to a full grown woman who learns how to control her power for good utilizing her natural love for her sister, and for her kingdom.  That said, there are so many good things about this movie, that everyone should own a copy of it to watch over and over.",5,R. V. Riccio,B0D626HRLD,2015-12-31
1013,R2FZ13I6AUEYCV,Best Disney movie ever!,"I love love love this movie! It's the coolest movie! I love the cast of characters, that the storyline is well versed. It starts out as Anna and Elsa, Anna is normal, Elsa has powers. Anna gets on Elsa's bed, tries to wake her up to go build a snow man. Elsa gets dragged down stairs into Anna's room and then Elsa releases her powers, Anna leaps tall snow hills until she flies and lands on the floor frozen. Her sister Elsa screams for help, her parents carry Anna to the trolls, the troll heals her memory and restores it to a happier time, when her and Elsa were playing. They walk away take Anna home, Elsa is forced to wear &#34; special gloves&#34; and conceal her powers, as the trolls revealed evil would only harm her and others. Her father shut her off from Anna, and she sings to Elsa to come build a snowman. Elsa and Anna grow up, one day Elsa is getting ready to be queen, and Anna wakes up late. So, she throws her dress on does her hair up, and dances around singing. She goes on a ship to arandelle where Elsa awaits her arrival. She meets Hans from the southern isles, he's charming, but, very helpful. She falls in love with him at the coronation of her sister, and when Elsa is crowned &#34; queen&#34; she tells Anna she's happy to see her. Before long Hans and Anna run along singing and Hans asks her to marry him, she says yes. She goes back into the castle, tells Elsa in front of the crowd, Elsa rejects her offer of marriage, and tells her not to go. She says &#34; what have I done wrong?&#34; And pulls off Elsa's glove. Elsa loses control of her powers and used her evil powers instead to create ice that would injure the towns people. They stared in utter shock, and Elsa fled the ocean waters, until it froze solid to north mountain. Anna told Hans she'd go after her, Hans stayed behind to mandate the kingdom. Anna left on her horse, fled to the north mountain to find Elsa. She comes up near the top, no cape on freezing, loses her horse, and is forced to fight the freezing air and snow. She stumbles upon a lodge, enters oakens lodge and asks for a coat and shoes. She's puzzled to see shoes but, no coat. Just then a tall, clumsy man comes into the lodge, he's covered in snow. Anna plays it off, and finds out in the den, it's none other than Sven and Kristoff. She tells Kristoff she has to find Elsa. He says he helps no one, acts stubborn and refusal. Anna persuades him to leave at night, so, they get into his sled, Sven runs faster, and faster, until Kristoff flies off after the wolves, the wolves attack him, Anna throws a blanket on fire at them. She puts Kristoff back in, the get to a cliff, the sled crashes, Kristoff has to be dragged up by Sven and anna. They continue until they find the stairway to where Elsa ice castle is. Once their closer the find Olaf, Elsa's childhood snowman, he scares Anna and Anna throws Olaf around until he's whole again. She puts a carrot on his face wrong, then fixes it. Olaf finds summertime relaxing and sings about it,then Anna and Kristoff move onwards with Sven and Olaf, to the ice castle, Anna and Kristoff find the icy stairway, climb it to the castle with Olaf. She's opening the doorway, Elsa appears after she's built her castle up, the chandelier, and the doorway with balcony. Anna tells her that arandelle is in a deep, deep, winter, that she must break the spell, so, she says she can't, she hits Anna with an icy blast. Anna flees the castle without Elsa. The marshmallow monster throws Olaf, breaks him into pieces.anna gets revenge only to anger marshmallow. He comes after them both and scares them to the cliff, Kristoff repels Anna downwards, marshmallow grabs the rope and Anna cuts it. They fall. Anna lands in the snow, Kristoff sees her hair, and Olaf says &#34; he hesitated&#34;. He says her hair isn't bad. They run to find the love experts, and when they find them, their hiding, and Olaf talks to them. They unroll out as trolls, and welcome Kristoff and later Anna, they try to fix them up, but, Kristoff says &#34; she's engaged&#34;. They try to troll fully we'd them, it doesn't work, so, the grandfather troll told her &#34; only an act of true love can save her&#34; they left, Sven flew thru the woods back to arandelle , dropped her off in the castles door way, she went inside told Hans she needs a &#34; true loves kiss&#34; he was prepared to kiss her, then left her abandoned, he told the king that she died. He lied. She was inside laying on the floor cold and lifeless, Olaf came in lit a match and saved her, until Elsa was captured, broke free, fled the dungeon and then Olaf got Anna out the window, they were trapped! Elsa was walking thru the blizzard, Kristoff was led by Sven to find Anna, Kristoff refused twice, he told Sven to hurry, he almost got to Anna but, by the time he was close, and Hans tried to kill Anna, she stopped hans short and froze solid! Her sister embraced her weeping. She felt her tears and her heart unfroze completely. From then on Anna and Elsa were in separable. Anna gave Kristoff a new sled, and Sven a new title, and then Hans was arrested and the old man was shipped off, Anna and Elsa let winter return after summer was restored in arandelle and ice skated. Anna and Kristoff were happier than ever.",5,April Bourne,B0D626HRLD,2014-03-24

1032,R160JORB8IT11X,Easy to upload images with app installation,"This Kosshe Digital Interface has an easy to use menu. If you wanted to share the photo frames for use by others in your family, you could go to Settings (purple button on the far right of screen) . Then scroll down below the QR code to User Management, and click the + plus button to add ""Users"" by their email address. They would have to decide what phone or tablet to install their  ""VPhoto"" app.  Options to change the transition effects appear by clicking on any one image and hitting the sprocket icon below.  The transition effect I chose is ""Flip"" but there's about 8 different options to choose from including ""Random"". You can also opt whether or not you want background music on.  You can shift the transition from 5 seconds to multiple other increments of time, all the way up to 1 minute.  For the music, you would have to install an mp3 either via internal storage, TF card, or USB.  When I plug it into my laptop, it shows up as ""MTP"" or ""T-1"" depending on where I'm looking for it.  From my Explorer folders it shows up as ""T-1"" and it tells me I have 5.69 GB of storage total on it internally. I've added a screenshot so you can see all the folders it comes installed with. It seems well organized.  One of the album settings is ""Sleep mode"" which is set by default at 21:00 to 9:00 if you decide to turn it on, but the default is off. You can simply unplug it from the power source if you want to turn it off; there is no battery on the device.  There is a back button in the Top left corner (Arrow Left)  if you ever need to go back to the original menu with all your settings. You may want to turn off ""Captions"" if you don't want details about the time and date stamp, etc on the images.  There's also a randomize function and you can resort the order if you prefer it to be organized in any other way. The default seems to be by time & date stamp.  You can also choose one of three ""Clock Skins"" and when you choose it, the clock will display instead of your photo images, in case you need a change of pace. And then after choosing a skin, it's still possible to change the design yet again with 8 designs by swiping left or right.  Originally I wanted to purchase this as a gift, but I'm glad I have many months to prep it for my parents to give me time to make it my own, too.  I like how the menu interface gives me the current time, date, and weather as well as a few photos in the corner.  I would show my mom where to find the language settings in case she preferred it in Chinese.  She's in a different time zone so I may have to check back in around Christmas to share how it was received.  If the sound of transferring photos is a bit much (it's something like an ice cream truck music mash-up), that can also be turned off in the Album settings> Notification sound. You can transfer about 50 photos max with the app. But the wire transfer from a computer seems to work easily with no particular limitations, aside from max storage capacity. Expect to spend at least 20 minutes learning where all the functions are, and enjoy customizing this thing to your heart's delight.  I also noticed that the images that I transferred via app are in folders under T1>internal storage>Cloud Album> Cloud> and that each transfer is only identifiable by the time stamp in the folder of images you transferred for each upload.  In other words, if you wanted to delete the pictures or identify them specifically to delete them, it would be easier to use the Kosshe Digital interface rather than from your computer, because there's a trashcan icon for each image.  There are no identifiers in the folder under Cloud, and the files don't seem readable from my computer, which I guess means they have transferred with a proprietory format.",5,S.

1033,RVBQBBSKGBOID,"Great for the price, easy to use.","The plastic frame is actually really nice, at a glance, it looks like wood.  Within a few minutes, I was able to add the app to my phone and start sending pictures to the frame.  Don't throw away the manual, there are a few things that were not easy to figure out.  For instance, there are two areas for settings.  The frame has settings and the ""folder"" has settings.  It took me some time to figure out how to turn off the loud, audible  new pictures notification.  Now I can silently add pictures.  What impresses me the most is the picture quality.  This is a really affordable frame, but the screen is bright and looks good from any angle.  I would recommend it.",5,Jay,B0D62CPFYZ,2024-07-19
1034,R34J2GAM7H7H42,Fun (but beware of pranksters)!,"This is hilarious!  You can give a code to anyone, and they can upload pics to your frame from anywhere.  There's a setting where it will say who did the upload (or you can turn that  off).  Now my teenager spends the day adding memes and crazy pictures to see how long it will take me to notice.  It's so fun!  This would be a great thing for grandparents who have grandkids scattered around the country (or the world).  Instead of sending school pics like in the old days,  you could upload pictures and snapshots to Grandma's picture frame every day, if you want.  There are a lot of nice settings, so you can decide how long you want each picture to stay on the screen.  It's a touch-screen, too, so you can swipe it back to look at pictures that have already been shown (but it will eventually cycle through them all again, of course).  The only downside I can see with this frame is that it has to be plugged in to an outlet at all times to work.  That, and it's an invitation for pranks (but I'm all for that!).",4,Amazon Customer,B0D62CPFYZ,2024-07-16
1035,R2GARULO1TLXRH,Absolutely LOVE it.,"It functions not only as a picture frame but also has clock, Alarm, weather updates and media player features. The display/picture quality is outstanding. It has a touch screen display so navigating through screens is very easy and intuitive. The app support is pretty easy to navigate too and transferring pictures and videos wirelessly is effortless. I prefer to put all the pictures i want to run on the frame on a USB and it takes about a minute after popping the USB in the frame for the pictures to start showing up but once in, it works great. i have not tried the memory card option yet. The wooden frame finish for the frame looks very premium and elegant. Overall very happy with this frame! Worth every penny",5,Yash Nanjundaswamy,B0D62CPFYZ,2024-07-18
1036,RKTVBIGPZ7FSQ,needing an app is disappointing,"This picture frame is a nice size and the frame can be rotated to be displayed either horizontal or vertical and you also have the option to mount it to the wall. There is not an option for batteries so if you want to move it or carry with you need to place near an outlet.  The setup was fairly easy but I do not like that I have to download an app.  I thought this frame would be great but I will go back to my other frame with my flash drive, old school but works great and no wifi needed. And, NO potential security issues.",3,scale modler,B0D62CPFYZ,2024-07-15
1037,R3G66FJM6MMLM0,If you read the reviews . . .,"If you read the reviews, you can honestly get the wrong impression of this photo frame, so I decided to take a chance on it and resolve the questions once and for all. Here's what I found: the instructions are clear and if you follow them step by step, everything works out great. Instead of adding photos, I added downloaded memes and laugh all day at my custom compilation of the internets funniest memes and I have the frame vertical, rather than horizontal, like a phone screen would be for the best view. This is easy to use, easy to set up, and provides lots of information on the home-screen, with time, temperature, day and date.  I'm still trying to figure out how anyone could have an issue setting this up and can honestly say it was not hard at all. Downloading the app was the longest part of setup.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",5,Benji and I . . .,B0D62CPFYZ,2024-07-15
1038,R13LQZR86JPH26,Takes a minute to figure out the app,"This photo frame is very cute, and feels sturdy. It took me a while to figure out the app, and I wish there was a web version instead. I eventually just opted for an SD card instead, as I didn't have to fuss with the app. I would like to use the collaboration feature but I wish there was a way to get rid of the names on the bottom of the photos showing who submitted it.  Overall the colors are excellent, it feels sturdy, and I have been enjoying it at home. I would definitely recommend this for the price.",5,Cheyenne,B0D62CPFYZ,2024-07-18
1039,R2BQV09L29VXVY,"Great picture quality and easy sharing, but setup can be tricky.","I recently purchased the 10.1"" WiFi Digital Picture Frame from Kosshe, and it has been a wonderful addition to my home. The picture quality is exceptional, with the 1280x800 IPS HD touch screen displaying photos and videos in vibrant detail. The frame’s sleek wooden design fits perfectly with my decor, and the auto-rotate feature ensures that my photos are always displayed correctly. The VPhoto app makes it easy to share photos remotely, which is a fantastic way to stay connected with family and friends.  However, I did find the initial setup to be a bit challenging. Connecting the frame to WiFi and getting the app to sync took some time and patience. Once everything was set up, though, it worked seamlessly. The 8GB built-in memory is ample for storing thousands of photos, and the additional support for micro SD cards and USB drives is a nice touch. Despite the setup hiccup, the frame’s overall performance and ease of use make it a great purchase for anyone looking to display their digital memories beautifully.",4,Chi Ly,B0D62CPFYZ,2024-07-14
1040,R33X7WAX9MWP1B,Works well!,"I'm impressed by this! The wood frame looks great, It's weird to say the Ui looks good on a picture frame, but it does. Very reminiscent of Windows 8. Clock/Alarm/Weather and photos are the main appeals to this and it does a great job at it. Plenty of good clock designs. Weather widget is a nice little QOL feature. The overall picture quality is really good. It's like, the perfect brightness for a photo frame. Plenty of inputs as well, not to mention the ability to add pictures over an app making it super easy.

1049,R2UJLIZ9FEJNOU,"Comodità, prezzo, portatilità al TOP ??","Prima di tutto parto con il dire che il mio giudizio si basa principalmente sul prezzo incredibile di questi auricolari:  1) AUDIO: Decisamente accettabile. Non adatto ad un audiofilo, i bassi sono piuttosto abbondanti e forse esagerati. Ma nell'ascolto generale non ci si rende nemmeno conto. Inoltre se si vuole intervenire sul suono, anche un applicazione di terze parti influisce bene.  2) Indossabilità: Ottima! Sono estremamente piccoli, comodi e leggeri. Sono presenti i gommini laterali per l'incastro all'interno dell'orecchio, ciò li rende anche adatti allo sport. (Soprattutto anche alla loro certificazione IPX8, per l'impermeabilità) Ad ogni modo all'interno della scatola sono forniti altri due gommini.  3) Custodia: La custodia mi ha positivamente colpito, lo schermo frontale si vede bene anche alla luce del sole, inoltre l'andamento della batteria è estremamente preciso e NON va in decine in decine, è corretto bello e preciso. La custodia è piccolissima, perfettamente tascabile e comoda.  4) Cancellazione del rumore attiva: Assente. Anche se i gommini hanno una buona cancellazione del rumore passiva.  5) Batteria: Custodia 500mAh, La batteria è più che abbondantemente sufficiente sia per gli auricolari che per la custodia. Difficilmente dovrete preoccuparvi della batteria. È il punto forte degli auricolari.  6) Applicazione: Assente.  Nel complesso sono ottimi auricolari SOPRATTUTTO per il prezzo che presentano. Se ne fate un uso poco eccessivo sono ottimi auricolari.",5,Paolo,B0D7M5DLSW,2023-12-15
1050,R35JIH3W9UKLDW,Top Kopfhörer auch für Kinderohren.,"Diese Bluetooth-Ohrhörer sind Top! Schon beim ersten Hören war ich von der Klangqualität begeistert, besonders beeindruckt hat mich der kraftvolle Bass, der in dieser Preisklasse seinesgleichen sucht. Die Klangwiedergabe ist klar und ausgewogen, was sowohl beim Musikhören als auch bei Podcasts und Anrufen überzeugt.  Ein weiterer Pluspunkt ist die bemerkenswerte Akkulaufzeit. Selbst bei intensiver sportlicher Aktivität oder langen Outdoor-Abenteuern halten die Ohrhörer problemlos durch. Das praktische Ladeetui ist nicht nur kompakt und stylisch, sondern informiert auch zuverlässig über den aktuellen Ladestand, sodass man stets im Bilde ist, wie viel Energie noch verfügbar ist.  Das Design der Ohrhörer ist ebenfalls gut durchdacht. Mit den bequemen Silikon-Ohrbügeln sitzen sie sicher und komfortabel, auch bei intensiven Bewegungen. Dies macht sie zur idealen Begleitung für sportliche Aktivitäten jeglicher Art. Zudem sind sie wasserdicht, was sie besonders robust und widerstandsfähig gegen Schweiß und Regen macht.  Die Verbindung mit meinem Smartphone war ein Kinderspiel. Binnen weniger Sekunden waren die Ohrhörer gekoppelt, und seitdem hatte ich keinerlei Verbindungsprobleme. Dies erleichtert die Nutzung ungemein und trägt zur hohen Benutzerfreundlichkeit bei.  Alles in allem bin ich von diesen Bluetooth-Ohrhörern absolut überzeugt. Sie bieten eine hervorragende Leistung zu einem unschlagbaren Preis und sind durch ihre durchdachten Features und das ansprechende Design eine klare Kaufempfehlung für alle, die auf der Suche nach zuverlässigen und leistungsstarken Ohrhörern sind.",5,Johann P.,B0D7M5DLSW,2024-07-01

Not only does it look sleek and high-end, but it’s super easy to use - and the sound is great quality… check out my video to hear it! Please note you may want to remove your phone case… because at first I thought the mic wasn’t working, but actually my phone case was preventing the receiver from going all the way in!

It is plug-and-plug and elementary to learn and use. The sound quality is great and the size is very tiny and compact. It's not very noticeable because it prevents distractions from other people staring at you. I just don't like the charger base.

1069,R1QJG2NLLJ1DT0,Small but mighty,"The size difference between this mic and Rode is obvious. It packs a lot of quality both on the sound captured and build materials.  If feels good, light and high quality. It’s also mind boggling how it manages to handle the strong magnetic field from the magnets (without any distortion or loss in frequencies).  The transmitter that connects to the phone (USB-C or Lightning) also has an input port that allows charging of the phone while in use. It’s a great addition for an aspiring v-logger with pretty good features for not so much money.  I’d definitely buy this again if it breaks down (or I lose a microphone).  The deadcat fits snuggly on it as it has an elastic band that fits perfectly. You cannot use the receivers as the same time on 2 devices as the mic pairs only with one receiver at a time.",5,yanascraftroomcom,B0D5YMWWSX,2024-07-24

I also asked someone with an iphone to test the lightning receiver (the kit comes with 2 receivers, lighting and usb-c), and it worked instantly for them as well. Unfortunately, you can only use one receiver at a time -- we tried both phones with receivers and only one was connected. The mics themselves were smaller than I expected, which is really nice for interviews where you don't want the mics to be seen, but also don't have the budget or the space to have a boom mic.

Out of the box I received the capture device, RCA cables, a CD and a user manual. Device is made out of plastic with permanently attached USB 2.0 cable, and a multi purpose input cable with RCA video and S video compatible ports. I wish these permanently attached cables were removable for storage purposes. As soon as I plugged in the device to my Mac Mini M2 and my Dell XPS PC it was recognized quickly. I have collected years of footage all the way to early 90s with my JVC PAL and my JVC NTSC camcorders, I was able to digitize them. It was lots of fun to share those memories with loved ones lived all around the country. I really like this device and it gets the jobs done. There are two caveats I'd like to address: one is permanently attached cables to the device, instead of plug in type, second one is critical, I wish it was USB 3.2 instead of USB 2.0 for faster data transfer. Other than these two issues I recommend this device.",4,T's Take,B0D86QG8NJ,2024-07-24
1074,RLHGYDDE7URT6,Easy VHS To computer transfer,"This is a great tool to finally get those old VHS videos saved to your computer. I did not expect it to work because I am using windows 11 but it did recognize the device and it easily captures my old videos.  At first, I had no sound while playing the video, only on playback of the recording but I made a few adjustments, and I got the sound to work.  If it helps anyone, I just went into control panel to hardware and sound, manage audio devices, recording tab, find the usb audio device(digital audio interface), choose properties, then check listen to this device.  After that I got full sound, and the device is working great to capture old videos.  I'm using it with my Movavi video editor.",5,debbie,B0D86QG8NJ,2024-07-22
1075,R2H4AUK2TR03VQ,Affordable Way To Digitalize Your Childhood Videos,"I wanted a way to digitalize my childhood videos which are all older camcorder and vhs style tapes. I have so many that I didn't want to spend $16/tape to have someone do it for me. So for the listed price of $16 this was a steal considering I had about 30 old tapes to digitalize.  Silly me forgot that my computer does NOT have a CD slot, so I was a bit scared that I wouldn't be able to install the drivers. But thankfully after plugging in the USB it was able to download the drivers necessary without the CD.  As far as the digital capture itself, you do need a video capture software (which this does not seem to come with... unless the CD I couldn't put in has it? But I doubt it). But I found a free version online and was able to use it with this device to start digitalizing my old tapes.  I'm a long way from done, but the savings is already paying off!",5,ChosenCho,B0D86QG8NJ,2024-07-10

1082,R3GRLLLFYNU2QS,Great pocket sized MP3 and video player but locked and write protected internal storage,"Works perfectly as an MP3 player and mini ebook reader and you can stream audio/videos with no buffering but the OS is locked and you can not install any other apps or app updates. You are also stuck with the interface/icons/wallpaper (just that one heart image wallpaper) unless you use an SD card and pick a personal photo or image to use instead. It runs a locked down version of Android 9 for MediaTek based devices but with full write protection enabled so there is no way to side load an APK to root or add Google services. If you are ok with just the preloaded apps (nothing wrong with them at all) this is a great little gadget. You can easily access other services via Chrome so you can still use it for things like email and messaging, or doom scrolling random social media sites. The battery lasts all day playing MP3's from the SD card and a few hours if you stream Pandora, etc. BT headphones and earbuds also sync without issue. Overall it is a really nice pocket media player and would also make for a great gift or even a ""starter phone"" type device to see how responsible your kids are before you plop down a few hundred on a real phone. Would have easily been 5 stars if it was not write protected with just the limited pre-installed apps available. Still recommended tho.",4,That Guy Over There,B0D4Z8DDYB,2024-07-20

1084,RWZ68DWFSE4QT,It’s pretty decent for what it is,"So I’ve never had an mp3 player. Back then I always had iPods. Being 2024, obviously all tech gadgets have changed. I don’t know if you can still get iPods actually. Everything is on our phones now. But this device serves as a nice way to be disconnected from your phone and just focus on the smaller things. The preloaded apps on here take up about 14% of the storage I believe. The storage on this device is fairly decent. It has quite a few different options for audiobooks as well which I liked. It also has a library app where you can input your location, address, zip code or any street you input and it will show you the nearest libraries around you, and if you have a library card , it allows you to listen to these books. Or has a kid friendly setting where you can modify the settings that are appropriate for your kid. Or also has a dimming setting which is easier on the eyes. Now for why I rated this 3 stars. The device itself is pretty cool. It’s very small and compact so it’s easy to take anywhere with you. You have to make sure you are connected to either WiFi or some kind of hotspot , otherwise unless you have downloaded some book content and pics, the apps won’t work for you. The settings for adjusting the time and date is automatically set to a different time zone and they are ALL international time zones. You will have to manually disconnect from that setting to input the proper time and date. The volume on this isn’t that high. It does give you a warning when you want to increase the volume of an alert to be careful of high high the volume is. The touch screen sensitivity is high. You can barely brush the screen and it will open an app that you didn’t intend to, however upon tapping on any app that you intend on using, the speed of which they open, switch pages, make a list of favorites, or inputting anything into the chrome search is pretty slow. It’s like a 5 second pause before an app will open and pull up any content, pics, information, next play list , etc. it has Apple Music on here, however since this is an mp3 player, you can’t just simply log into your Apple account and all your music will show up. You have to pay for a membership, even if you’re already an Apple product owner with an Apple ID. That was a deterrent for me since the playback, and general speed of this device is quite slow. I actually appreciate and enjoy the pandora app on here and the FM radio app. To listen to anything, you have to USB connect to a speaker or use the provided headphones as the antenna for the FM radio stations. The power button is on the right side , below the button for volume. Unlike smart phones, you can’t just touch the screen to wake it up and unlock it. You have to press the power button on the side ( short press ), to wake up the screen. As of now, I can’t really grade the battery life on this. It came at 97% charged when I got it and opened it. Charging cord and earbuds with different sizes silicone buds are provided. So that contributes a little to the whole package of this item. Overall, I’m not quite sure how often I’d reach for this device as things on my iPhone are much easier and faster to operate and utilize , but if you’re using this for kids, then it’s a great device to have.",3,R-Sora Flood,B0D4Z8DDYB,2024-07-17
1085,RJSSA0R542BJV,Not just for kids.,"I didn't order this for the kids. I wanted it. I've been leaving my phone in the next room, so I can slow life down, not having to respond ASAP. I want this to listen to music and books. I just received it, so I'm still playing around with it. This is totally new for me. I signed into a couple of my accounts and pushed play. I was VERY glad to find that it had a built-in speaker! Yeah, it might just a little tinny, but I don't have an issue with that. And in a quite house, it's loud enough. It's sitting on the arm of my recliner and I have no issues hearing every word. And I didn't put it at 100%. If I put it in my front pocket, I would be able to hear it while walking around. I didn't want to always wear something in my ear. I may look into a small bluetooth speaker, for the times it's not as quite. I'm playing music on Amazon right now and the lyrics are scrolling on the screen! How fun is that? I would think any child would love that. I remember wanting to know the words of a new song. My 5 stars are for all it has to offer, that I have yet to tap into. Nice little player. In my case, helps me relax just listening to music as I go about my day. I like it. It's small and can do a lot of things to keep anyone busy, if they want to be. It's fun for any age.",5,piglets,B0D4Z8DDYB,2024-07-07
1086,R1V0IC4QWYANI8,A nice mp3 player with the ability to browse the internet,"I'll start off saying this mp3 player was something I had hoped to be able to customize and add apps etc. I was met with a OS that cannot be modified at all.  With that out of the way, the mp3 player itself functions as nice as any other brand on the market. Apps load pretty fast, you can read ebooks, watch videos with the chrome app, and even has parental controls for kids! (Very nice)  The chrome app feels a bit...slow, but not crazy slow. There is some noticeable lag while watching some videos on it but its very minimal. (remember this is a budget mp3 player and not a flagship phone)  Battery life is pretty good too unless you leave it playing youtube videos overnight, which I did. (There is some heat coming from the back where the battery is) This happens with most budget electronics and even some flagship phones so do not worry that much about it unless it gets overly hot.  Overall I am very happy with this mp3 player and will use it on long drives in my truck!",5,larry daniel workman,B0D4Z8DDYB,2024-07-22
1087,R3748W4CDLNHJM,"Pretty cool, but...","First, this is great if you don't want any customization. It's a basic mp3 player. Plays music, videos, and photos. A minimum ebook capability. The screen isn't very bright. The video player is very basic. Limited customization and format playing. The FM radio only works with plug-in aux earbuds. It doesn't support installation of additional apps. This means not on the browser, not on the playstore, and not APK, XAPK, or EXE. Once an app is deleted, it's gone forever, unless you factory reset the mp3 player.  That's all the negatives so now for the positives  It really is great for kiddos. I mean, it's basic, but that's what one wants for kids. Not being able to install apps is a huge bonus. In fact, most of the above negatives can be positives if you are getting this for a kid. The browser works great and youtube, x, and amazon all work on it. The battery life lasts about a full day of music playing (screen off, no wifi,) It will last about 3 hours on straight video. And the fact that it can hold a memory card is pretty handy. Overall, I have had many other MP3 players, and I think that one word describes this one: Average.",4,Schnoodlydabobbob,B0D4Z8DDYB,2024-07-23
1088,RHWSEKTPML7AA,Good For Adults As Well!,"I was recently looking for a music player to entertain my kids as well as to keep them occupied during errands without handing over your phone. I ended up liking the kids MP3 player so much that I decided to get one similar to theirs for myself. This MP3 Player with simple controls works great! This nifty device is packed with features that are perfect for both children and adults, but the real win here is its incredible ease of use. The Buttons are clearly labelled and the interface is intuitive. I was able to add my music and play my favorite songs and audiobooks in minutes. The simple use and long battery life provides me with my favorite songs and captivating audiobooks for hours.  The MP3 player is constructed well and if treated well it should last a long time. The screen is bright and easy to navigate as well. The interface reminds me of an older Samsung phone and I think that is perfect for this device.  Overall, this MP3 Player is great for adults who want a simple media player with a solid price. It's easy to use, and packed with features, giving you hours of audio entertainment.",5,Captain Frugal,B0D4Z8DDYB,2024-07-20
1089,RU98UNQB0X7SL,Decent little media player,"I ordered this little media player so that I can stream music from on my home speaker. It is very basic and has very, limited apps since it is meant for use by kids, but that shouldn't stop grown ups from wanting one! It comes pre-installed with Spotify, Pandora, Deezer, Amazon Music, Kindle, and a few other music and audiobook streaming apps, plus Chrome browser. Unfortunately, you can't add any additional apps, which is fine since I plan to only stream from Spotify.  The parental controls are super easy to setup if you plan to let your kids use it. Which allow you to set a usage timer or scheduled timer so that it blocks the use of the device when time is up!  One downside is there is no way of updating the apps should they become outdated and it is hard to tell if the device itself will automatically update, but as long as the version of the apps installed are supported, there is no huge urgency to update them. Another limitation is that I see no way of changing the theme (icons), and you need to download an image or transfer one from micro-SD card if you want to set a different wallpaper.",4,A.,B0D4Z8DDYB,2024-07-18
1090,R34MW54CHV3M1I,Very usable for audio books,"Basic android system, but not too much you can do with it. That's okay for me as I only want to play audio books on it, and do not plan to use it online or with other than minimal apps. (In fact, I wiped most of them off as soon as I got it. They all come back again if you do a reset, so they aren't gone for ever if you change your mind.)  Head phones are adequate--a cut above a dollar-store pair. Nothing special, but okay.  The icon theme can not be changed from the kiddie-appealing appearance, but it can be minimized a bit by changing the wallpaper.  Volume at full blast is almost too low to hear without head phones--although it could be heard in a quiet room if it was in a shirt pocket. Any other situation and it would not be audible to most people.  Directions are minimal, so you have to figure it all out pretty much on your own. If you have used Android devices before that shouldn't be too hard.  The FM radio works fine--it comes in clearly.  The main problem for me (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is that the case gets pretty hot above the battery area--which can't be good. The battery life seems reasonable (although the over-heating problem I mentioned may limit its life in the long run).  Overall, this is a nice little mp3 player for kids and the occasional adult--like me--who doesn't want to break the bank for a usable audio book reader.",4,Deborah S.,B0D4Z8DDYB,2024-07-09
1097,R19YECPQB5MX9U,Amazing earbuds!,"Upon opening, I loved the immediate use with battery already charged.  The weight and appearance were very pleasant and acceptable.  I found they easily paired to phone and were recognized immediately.  There was no need to change the ear tips as they were just right for me.  Extra sizes were available if needed.  The contour shape fit perfectly over my ears feeling very secure.  The quality of sound was unexpectedly amazing, even compared to previous purchases that were more expensive.  Battery life caught me by surprise and loved the display to show it!  While riding on a noisy bus it allowed me to relax and focus on my music, while the outside noise was muted out.  The sound quality was equivalent and surpassed major sellers that were definitely more expensive. I felt this was one of the best earbuds that are out there for purchase.  The sleek case fit nicely in my pocket and very protective at all times.  I like that you can wear one at a time if you need to be able to hear something else since it definitely stops all noise when wearing two at same time.  You will not go wrong by buying these and even another pair for a friend or family member.  This would make a great gift at this affordable price!  You will be able to use enjoy this purchase for a long time!!",5,Carlla Miller,B0D948J9D3,2024-03-12
1098,R1RIT98XG7SH7J,Great product!,"This was a great purchase for several reasons. First, they fit comfortably and secure around my ears. This is helpful as I'm often listening to music on the move. It's very nice when I'm exercising as I don't need to worry about my earbuds coming off. Second, these earbuds have great sound. I can hear the high notes and the low notes. It comes through crystal clear. Third, these earbuds have a very long charge. This is so helpful as I don't need to recharge them for a long period of time. And when they new to recharge, I can just throw them on my phone charging pad. The case acts as a charger. Not only do the earbuds have a long charge, but they can recharge in the case. I appreciate the charging gauge on the case. This provides quick access to see the level of charge that is present. Then I always know when a recharge may be warranted. The cost is incredible for the functionality and sound of these earbuds. They are just as good with extra added features compared to other expensive brands. I am not sure why someone would pay so much money for other earbuds that don't have all the fesutes that these have. Why pay more for something that is less? I've purchased from this company before. Fortunately, I have not had to use the warranty, but the company has been very responsive in the activation of the promised warranty. I am very happy with the purchase of the earbuds. The shipping time was super fast. It came with its own charging cable. It also has different sized comfortable ear buds to fit different ears. The earbuds also have touch control adjustments which are very convenient. So when I'm on the move I can answer phone calls or skip tracks without having to pull out my phone. The earbuds also easily connect to your device. Just have to pull them out and they easily connected to my phone. Super duper easy. I would definitely purchase this product again! Thank you!",5,Jacob,B0D948J9D3,2023-06-30
1099,R3KGV6FIB8Y9GJ,Good value option sport earbuds,"The charging case is streamlined and lighter than I would have expected. The lighted display is helpful, and stays lit for an acceptable amount of time. The charging port is a convenient USB - C and is located on the side so that it doesn’t interfere with opening or closing the lid Some other earbuds with the charging port on the back seem to tend to have the cord come unplugged easily when opening or closing the lid. The headphones themselves stay in place very well.  They are comfortable for me to wear for extended periods of time.  The sound quality is decent.  Very good for the price.  The battery life is also good for the price.  The IPX7 rating for water resistance is very good for sport oriented headphones to wear at the gym or while running.  The controls are intuitive and I had paired them and used most of the functions before ever looking at the manual. I paired only one, and then the other used the same pairing setup, making it possible to use either one or both without having to set a separate pairing profile as with some other buds. It is convenient that the play, pause, and incoming call commands are identical for either the left or the right side.  The only command that is different is the next track on the right and the previous track on the left.  There is also a voice assistant command that is helpful as well, and can be set up to Google, Apple, or Amazon services. The rated battery life seems approximately accurate, as does the case battery life.  Additional color options would be a nice update in the future.  It seems possible to me that the ear hook might be shaped or sized poorly for some people, though it fits me perfectly.  An option to switch that out to another shape or size seems like it might be helpful as well.",5,Ray,B0D948J9D3,2023-07-08
1100,R11RHP87ZA8AO5,Excellent value,"I wanted to share my experience with these amazing wireless headphones I received. They offer a winning combination of comfort, decent bass, and an incredible battery life that left me truly impressed considering how much they cost. First, let's talk about comfort. Finding in-ear headphones that fit snugly and comfortably can be a challenge, but these headphones nailed it. With a range of ear tips to choose from, I easily found the perfect fit for my ears. During my daily run, they stayed securely in place, thanks to their lightweight design. Wearing them for extended periods, I barely even noticed they were there. Now, onto the bass. I must admit, I had doubts about the bass performance of wireless in-ear headphones. However, these headphones pleasantly surprised me. They deliver a decent bass response that adds a nice punch to my music without overpowering other frequencies. Whether I'm grooving to EDM beats or rocking out to heavy guitar riffs, the bass enhances the overall listening experience and brings my favorite tracks to life. The battery life on these headphones is outstanding. I'm amazed at how long they last on a single charge. I enjoy around 10 hours of continuous playback on average, which is more than enough for my daily music sessions. The quick recharge feature ensures I never have to wait too long to dive back into my groove. Not worrying about running out of battery throughout the day is a game-changer, especially when I'm on the move. I also appreciate the additional features these headphones offer. The built-in controls allow me to adjust volume, skip tracks, and even answer calls without reaching for my phone. It's incredibly convenient, particularly during workouts. The Bluetooth connectivity is reliable and seamless, ensuring a stable connection with my devices. Lastly, the build quality of these headphones is impressive. Despite their lightweight construction, they feel sturdy and durable. This gives me confidence that they'll last for a long time. Additionally, the included charging case keeps them powered up, eliminating any concerns about battery life. To sum it up, these wireless headphones have surpassed my expectations. They provide exceptional comfort, decent bass, and boast an outstanding battery life that keeps me grooving throughout the day. If you're searching for reliable wireless in-ear headphones that check all the right boxes, I highly recommend giving these a try.",5,Bobby,B0D948J9D3,2023-06-27
1101,R1T5ZS26U36CAO,Long Battery life and Comfortable,"The GNMN Bluetooth headphones are pretty decent headphones. I primarily use them when doing yard work and taking walks around the neighborhood listening to YouTube videos. In comparisons to some of the mid brand names I would say that these are right up there. They've got a plastic build that may cheap but they are very well built.The ear pads are comfortable you could wear them all day without a second thought.  They have a good balance between bass, mids, and highs, making everything from your go-to tracks to the latest movies sound good. The noise cancellation is on the low end compared to big brands.  Pairing is pretty straight forward. The Bluetooth connects so smoothly compared to others. The battery life is legit, offering hours upon hours of playtime, which means less worrying about your next charge and doing more listening. The battery life is extremely long, along with the charging case.  Bottom line, the GNMN Bluetooth headphones are a solid buy. They deliver top-notch sound, comfort, and durability, all wrapped up in a simple design. For those who want a decent long battery life and very decent sound for listening to videos and music, these headphones are a clear winner.",5,keith,B0D948J9D3,2024-03-14
1102,R1TVD8Q8EBKOMZ,Super,"If you could only imagine, my frustration in trying to find the perfect pair of Bluetooth earpieces, you would understand that coming across these things (which has been nothing short of amazing) has been such a relief.  There's lots of different brands to choose from and it's hard to trust which ones you can get accustomed to. Some aren't loud enough. Some don't have enough range. Some are just plain uncomfortable.  I work at a large chain pizza place. Which means loud ovens all day. They hold up to the loudness surrounding you enough to be able to hear your entrainment. Or phone calls, whichever. Phone calls are perfect. No dropping, clear sound. Noise cancelling.. All perfect. It has very good volume. They go 'in' ear. I don't know why some brands are trying to push 'out' ear Bluetooths, where it just sits on the outside of your ear. No. Just no. I can't imagine anyone liking that kind of thing when they won't stay put. It's just weird I'm sorry. These go IN the ear and they stay in!  Speaking of comfort, they are lightweight. The lightest Bluetooth I've ever had. But don't mistake them for being cheap and crappy. Given the cheap price point, don't let that deter you from buying, for fear they will suck. They absolutely don't suck. The price was awesome, a lot cheaper than the other brands I spent my money on. But with the awesome usage of this brand, you get the comfort on point as well. The ear hook is lightweight and very flexible, hassle-free to put on.  Also, the more impressive quality with this, is the range. At work, I go into a walk-in fridge and the door closes while I'm in there arranging stuff occasionally, while my phone is set down somewhere on the outside. It never loses connection. Doesn't even flinch. That's the best thing about these. The range is crazy good. Better than any other brand I've tried. I've even cooked in my kitchen at home while my phone was in my bedroom while I was wearing these and it stays connected and playing whatever I'm listening to. At all times.  Battery life is out of this world. They're fully charged right out of the box. Easy installation. I haven't needed to charge not once since buying them and it's been a week.  It has volume control, answer/end call button or stop/play button, whatever it is. It's awesome. I know I keep saying that, but I'm in love with these. It's just a beautiful pair of Bluetooth earbuds. And my favorite I've owned so far and I have owned a lot in my time. Also, there's a voice prompt for every navigation. A woman sounds off when you are connected and tells you if the volume is at maximum and tells you the number in which someone is calling you if you're not at your phone. Could be great for the visually impaired.  I love these so much????",5,UltraTopSat,B0D948J9D3,2023-07-09
1103,RLINAA057XFIA,Great earbuds at an affordable price,I really enjoy using the GNMN earbuds at work to reduce the ambient surrounding noise and at home so as not to bother my family with my audio. These earbuds have an ergonomic design with soft ear caps that’s comfortable to wear. They have flexible and soft ear hooks that help them stay in your ears even with active movements. The earbuds have a smart touch system that allows you to control your music and answer calls. I especially like the long battery life in these earbuds. Each earbud offers up to 10 hours of listening time on a single charge and the case can charge the earbuds for additional time. The first pairing of the earbuds with my phone was so easy and they automatically connect with subsequent use. These earbuds deliver HD stereo sound with strong bass and clear and bright treble which makes the musical experience more vivid. I would recommend these earbuds to anyone who’s looking for a high quality earbuds at a reasonable price.,5,Kindle Customer,B0D948J9D3,2024-03-05
1104,R14ROGR7V1LI6I,Great headphones,"I’m always skeptical when it comes to buying headphones because I can never find a pair that fits and ones that I like. I was very impressed with these as I took them out of the packaging. These headphones are slightly bigger than regular wireless headphones that look like AirPods. These fit in my ears better than the other headphones I’ve received from this company. I like the behind the ear support, so they won’t fall out. I was told I have little ears and other wireless headphones don’t stay in my ears. I can lay down, jump around, run and exercise and they’re not going anywhere, these fit great! It’s hard to find a good headphone that you can do basically anything with that won’t cost you an arm and a leg to obtain. I’ve had them for a week now and they’re only at 97% charged. So they hold a pretty good charge in and out of the case. I like the capability to turn the volume up or down with just the swipe around the earbud. The sound is absolutely phenomenal! They cancel out noise very well even at the lowest setting so if you like listening to your music very loudly like I do, don’t expect to hear anything or anyone! The sound quality is amazing! Perfect for flights or when you want to drown someone out that’s talking excessively. It comes with a cute charging case that looks like a mini eyeglass case so very easy to keep up with. I would highly recommend these headphones to anyone looking for a great, reliable and reasonably priced wireless headphones. I wouldn’t spend my money anywhere else. I can honestly say that these headphones are the truth and I’m excited to see how long they last, hopefully for a very long time!!",5,Krystle Lisbon,B0D948J9D3,2023-07-20

Once paired, the remote worked well.  It is so much nicer than my first generation remote.  It is also a better value than a genuine Amazon replacement remote.",4,J. T.,B0D49HKPMG,2024-07-21
1109,R1JGMQJTAMUNGF,Works like a charm,Paired it to my old 2nd generation cube to test it out and will keep it aside for any of the three Fire 4K stick remotes that might break.  Good purchase but with old fashioned pre-programmed buttons which is great.,5,Arin,B0D49HKPMG,2024-07-21
1110,R303F25T9X0XFU,Good but not perfect,"Edit number 2.: when I received this remote I put new batteries in it. After researching I learned that new batteries might solve the turning on syndrome and it did. The pause button is finicky. It won’t pause on the first push and needs to be pushed again. Edit. After several days of using this remote after I turn off the tv using the remote the tv within about 3 minutes comes on.  The only way to stop this from happening is to unplug the tv.  If it wasn’t for this problem we love the remote.  I love it!  Synced seamlessly with my Insignia TV. Took about 2 minutes. All the buttons, including the Alexa voice button, work perfectly.  Best part of all is the price!",4,mphoto,B0D49HKPMG,2024-07-19
1111,R23C5BRCCUU10W,Perfect Replacement,"First off, I've never had the pro remote.  This did, however, flawlessly connect to my FireTV.  At first it didn't turn my TV off and on and I noticed that there wasn't an IR blaster and thought that I wasn't going to be able to use it.  But all you have to do is go into your FireTV settings and change the remote mode to ""Discreet"".  Overall, I'm super happy with it and the build quality is solid.  It doesn't have backlit keys or the 1 and 2 shortcut buttons, but it is a great replacement if you're in a pinch and on a budget.",5,Hogee Pogee,B0D49HKPMG,2024-07-10

1123,R2A3UMRSRWUPX3,Se desconectaban el ratón y teclado pero lo he solucionado,"Estuve a punto de devolverlo ya que quería el switch para no tener que estar cambiando los cables de teclado y ratón entre mi ordenador personal y el portátil del trabajo, pero en el ordenador personal que uso para jugar, el teclado y ratón cada cierto tiempo se desconectaban y se volvían a conectar, era un micro corte en torno a 1 segundo, pero como es en el ordenador para jugar que te pase es muy molesto. En cambio en el portátil del trabajo no sufría ese problema.  Investigué y encontré el problema, en mi caso era porque la placa base al ser moderna, los pci estaban configurados en gen4, modifique en la BIOS para que trabajarán en gen3 y desde entonces no se me ha vuelto a desconectar, lo pongo aquí por si a alguien le pasa y le ayuda, ya que veo en los comentarios de estos productos problemas similares.  En cuanto el producto en si está bien, cumple su función, los cables son de un metro y medio y he tenido en mi caso que comprar otros, vendrían un poco más largos pero en general debería servirte.  En mi caso tengo conectado teclado, ratón, el adaptador inalámbrico de los cascos y una webcam y no ha sido necesario utilizar la toma de alimentación externa, funciona todo sin problemas  En cuanto a la función de switch, es un sistema simple, hace lo mismo que si tú desconectaras el teclado a mano de un pc y lo conectarás a otro, no simula una interfaz para que el ordenador crea que el teclado y ratón están conectados por lo que tarda en hacer el cambio lo que tarda en reconocer el ordenador los periféricos de nuevo, lo normal 2-3 segundos, pero es rápido en mi caso no molesta. Si necesitas algo más rápido entonces tiene que ser uno que mantenga en cada ordenador las conexiones pero son mucho más caros ese tipo de sistema, tampoco permite conmutar el switch con atajo de teclado, otros switch al realizar una combinación de teclado cambia el switch al otro dispositivo, en este caso solo se puede cambiar por el boton",5,Ivan Hurtado Lara,B0D69L9SJV,2023-08-24
1124,R1FDBYJKNBYWPG,Perfekt fürs Home-Office,"Ich habe mir den Hub fürs Home-Office zugelegt, weil mich jedes Mal das Umstecken der 1000 USB Kabel aufgeregt hat. Okay, genau genommen nur 4 aber das reicht auch, zumal die neuen Laptops wieder nur 2 ""normale"" USB-A anschlüsse haben, reicht für Maus und Tastatur, fürs Headset reicht es schon nicht mehr.  Der Hub macht einen erstaunlich qualitativen Eindruck, das Gehäuse scheint aus Metall zu sein, was ihm ein gewisses Gewicht verleiht. Das Gewicht wiederum hält ihn trotz der eingesteckten Kabel einigermaßen am Schreibtisch an seiner Position, was ich sehr positiv finde! Angesteckt sind eine beleuchtete Tastatur, Funkmaus, Headset und der USB-Hub vom Monitor. Am normalen PC leuchtet die Tastatur, am Laptop nicht - das ist aber ganz klar kein Mangel des Hubs, sondern liegt daran, wieviel der jeweilige USB-Port an Strom liefert, da gibt es deutliche Unterschiede!  Und das wichtigste: Umschalten klappt auch problemlos innerhalb von ~2 Sekunden, bis die USB Geräte vom Computer wieder erkannt werden!",5,Amazon Kunde,B0D69L9SJV,2023-05-19

When connected the ear buds/headphones sounded very clear.  It says it holds a charge for 40 hours but I haven't had them that long to verify.  They fit nicely on my ear and didn't fall off when I was walking briskly.  The directions are easy to use with 9 different functions with the multi function button (answer call, reject call, volume up and down, play, pause, previous or next song).  I would recommend these.

I wasn’t sure about these since I’ve never seen headphones that attach around the side of the ear, but they hold on so tight! They’re also so light that you don’t even feel them on. Jumping, running, bending over—no movement from the headphones at all. Easy to connect and charge, and the sound quality is good!",5,Stephanie,B0D5XX22X2,2024-07-12
1127,R23T7DFQZ71KGJ,Happy with these. Surprised by high sound quality.,"I've been really happy with these since I'm active and go on frequent runs. These don’t go inside your ears like regular earbuds, so they’re much more comfortable. Even during my hardest workouts, they stay put because of the ear hooks. They’re also lightweight, so I can wear them for hours without any discomfort, which is a big plus compared to my AirPods Pros, especially when I'm running.  The sound is crisp, with clear highs and deep lows, and the open design lets me stay aware of my surroundings. This is super handy when I’m out in NYC. So far, the battery life has been fantastic and lasts way longer than my AirPods, so I don’t have to worry about them dying on me. All in all, these headphones have been a good find and are way cheaper than the Bose and Beats ones I'd been eying.",5,Kelly Jiang,B0D5XX22X2,2024-07-15

This new version of the this model headset is clearly built to have high quality just like me old headset. There honestly is nothing wrong with the old one, yet at the same time the new model does seem to have a stronger Bluetooth connection, and the sound is a bit crisper. I will say that so far I have not been disappointed at all with the product quality, sound quality, battery life, or the Bluetooth range of the headsets I have bought from this company.

The antenna has a very small footprint.  Installation was simple and several mounting options are provided.  The most difficult part was finding the spot and positioning for the best reception.  I mounted mine in a window that is covered by a drape and it works very well, even on rainy or cloudy days.  The picture is crisp and clear, even on my older flat screen.

The antenna's sleek design and easy installation process make it an attractive addition to any home theater setup. The ability to receive all local channels for free is a massive plus, making it an investment that pays for itself many times over.

I’m even picking up more channels than my last one. It was a good upgrade for the price. I have recommended it to a few friends and family.

Still good simple and low coast antenna and I am probably buying a second one for another TV, and maybe third for Mom's house;  I do recommend! as it easier to use than some of the of the flat plastic mat type.  5 thumbs up.

1170,RXGU2PAC7CJR2,Excellent quality antenna,"I received this NewFoot HD TV antenna, and tested it out. I was very pleased with the amount of channels I was able to get, as well as the excellent picture quality. I've attached pictures showing various channels I received. They are shown as DTV Air, which is this antenna. I attached a quick video as well.  The antenna comes with a USB connection powered signal amplifier, which has a switch for 30 miles or 60 miles. However, for me, the signal was strong enough without the need for the signal amplifier, so I connected the antenna's coax cable directly to my TV. It's good that the amplifier is included in the box, just in case it's needed.  I currently had an HD flat antenna that goes on a wall. It was limited to only one spot at the top of the wall where it provided a good signal. When I hooked up this NewFoot antenna, I was able to put it in a lot more places and still got an excellent signal. I even put it low to the floor, and it still worked perfectly. That makes it a whole lot easier for mounting choices.  Lastly, I was able to receive 31 channels from the flat antenna. I received 49 channels from this NewFoot antenna. Now I have even more channels to choose from. I am very pleased with this antenna, and would certainly recommend it. Thank you.",5,SL,B0D93K9QKN,2024-03-13

1177,RQ62445FUVFEA,Great wireless outdoor secure camera  with endless mounting option,Being wireless  battery operate and magnetic mount give me endless options to mount any where in the house.

1182,R2RE8DVVAQ5152,Love this Security Camera with 2-way Audio,"Let me tell you why I love this 2K security camera. First it uses the VicoHome app to install, view the camera, and adjust its options. This is the second camera that I have purchased that uses the VicoHome app and it is very easy to use the app for setting up the camera and for viewing the camera and for setting up its various options. The app also has a limited but free cloud storage with the option to purchase more storage and gives the camera more options.  Second this camera is very easy to install the camera as it has a magnetic mount that I really love so you can mount it on a magnetic service using no screws. If you want to mount it to a non-magnetic service then it does come with an adapter that you can use with screws. With the magnetic base, it can be adjusted at any angle.  This camera uses a rechargeable battery that should last for 6 months before you need to recharge it and due to the magnetic camera mount it is easy to remove the camera for charging.   The picture quality is great due to its 2K HD video and has two-way audio. It includes a 32G SD card for local storage and the color night vision is really nice.  It uses Wi-Fi so no wired connection is needed.  The camera has motion detection with a spotlight and a siren alarm if you desire to setup the camera along with notifications. It is waterproof so it can be used outdoors.  It is really a great camera at a great price. I highly recommend it.",5,J. J. J.,B0D4Y72BCS,2024-07-24
1183,R15F4LLH915PTD,Safe & Secure,"I’ve been using my Security Camera for a few days now and I really like it. I was amazed how easy it was to set up. I did have some concerns of how sturdy the camera would be on my house, but there is a mounting bracket and a very strong magnet that is supplied with the camera, and it really keeps the camera secure. There is an app I can download, which I did immediately after installing the camera. I can’t get over how clear the day and night images are.! This security camera has many impressive features such as motion detection, an alarm, sleep mode, and many more. I’m definitely happy I purchased this camera. I’m also thinking about get one for my sister for Christmas.",5,Princess M.,B0D4Y72BCS,2024-07-24
1184,R1CTC86AYWH5PL,Wow! I’m impressed!,"I have 4 other cameras in and around my house and this one just might be my favorite. It’s so easy to remove from the base to charge/reposition, has a super strong magnet, and feels very high quality. The night vision is far superior to my other cameras. And I love the option to activate an alarm and light when needed. This will give me extra peace of mind for sure. Definitely recommend. You won’t regret this purchase.",5,Stephanie McDonald,B0D4Y72BCS,2024-07-24
1185,RK88GE6G1OM2N,The best there is... Period,"This review is coming with a heavy heart because Jabra has recently announced they will no longer be making ear buds. This is especially sad because these gen 2s are truly the best ear buds on the market in 2024 by a large margin. I live in East buds 4-8 hours a day and I have tested all the top buds like the sony xm5, bose qc ultra, technics az80s, sennhiezer twm4s and the jabra elite 10 gen 1s. The Gen 1s were the best overall against all of these... the gen 2 elite 10s are better but no longer an overall better, they are superior or equal to all these other top ear buds in every category. Better sound, ANC, hear through, comfort, fit, feel, app support, features, size, connectivity, reliability, and button controls. my biggest gripe with the gen 1s were their hear through mode, it needed a lot of help, and it got it. there is a stark difference in hissing noise, volume, and clarity in these new gen 2s and it's like you're not wearing anything now. the ANC of the gen 1s were already just barely shy of QC ultras which were the best despite the bose being unusable due to connectivity glitches. the gen 2s are now equal to or better than QC ultras. They have full crisp powerful sound you can feel with hard hitting bass and intricate notes, crazy ANC like magically turning the world off, awesome tactile push button controls so you dont have to fiddle with that annoying touch sensor BS on other ear buds, highly customizable and configurable app. These are the ear buds you want and its not even close. The only other ear bud that might be worth looking into is the sennhiezer TWM4s if you like less powerful but extremely intricate detailed sound in certain types of music like classical perhaps, they offer a bit more minute detail but lack the fullness and power these offer. i prefer to feel the music not just listen so elite 10 gen 2s are it.",5,Maximus Joseppi,B0D5DLF39S,2024-07-18
1186,R36K9LL4OM6NE0,They don't hurt! Yay!,"Bose QC hurt, but these Jabra Elite 10 Gen 2 are so comfortable that I can lay on my side pillow to ear and not feel any discomfort. Awesome BLOSSOM! I got mine coco colored and ""Andy's"" engraved on the top lid. Love how the Jabra website has more color options, but took awhile to get it engraved and in the coco color I wanted. The physical buttons are easy to press and have no pressure if pressing the earbuds inward. I wish the ANC/ambient mode switch could be on press/hold on both earbuds, but it's only a single press for the left. I have double press as next track and triple press for previous track for both earbuds. These are way better than the Samsung pro buds 2. I wished all earbud companies don't keep copying the airpods stems out of the ear!",5,Andy,B0D5DLF39S,2024-07-19
1187,R1TTSUV5Q2LZV2,Top Quality Earbuds,"Using the iPhone 15 Pro Max  They connect extremely fast! Bass is not like bose but it's good! Mids are on the same level as bose.  The thing that has been a benefactor for me is the microphone! The microphone is extremely good! They definitely upgraded the microphone. The best thing about these that I had a problem with other earbuds is the music is not dependent of eartips! So if you need to go smaller eartips you don't sacrifice sound, if you have tried a bunch of earbuds you know what I'm talking about!  Earbuds I have tried: Momentum 4, bose Ultra, beats fit pro, airpods pro 2, Cambridge Audio Melomania M10  Also the a feature of these that is going to be a game changer is being able to plug these into anything that has a 3.5mm audio jack and use them on that device!",5,louie,B0D5DLF39S,2024-07-07

I didn’t use it that often and when I did, it was mostly just to stand my phone up while watching videos. Went to go prop it up to watch something on my phone and the inside ring just broke off. Of course it is after the return date that it breaks. Was going to go ahead and purchase another one, but after reading some of the comments I see this is an issue with others as well. Not very happy to see comments about it breaking after a couple months, when before I purchased it I didn’t see any negative comments.

Interestingly, a slower charging may extend the life of your iPhone. When I charge overnight, I typically use a lower watt charger. For fast charging a 20 watt works great. The charging cords are 10 feet long. For my needs this is usually much more length than I need.  However, if your electrical outlet is far from your need to use the phone, 10 feet is more than enough.",5,Lynda Eirich,B0D6C2MF57,2024-07-01

1226,R30L80XWN3KHH,Basic earbuds that work as expected; I like this item,"Item:  Clipsun store’s Wired Earbuds 2 Pack, Fits All 3.5mm Jack Devices Price:  $7.20 after vendor 10% discount on 07 24 24  I’d forgotten there were two identical earbud sets in this item. Right after they came in I plugged one of them into my Samsung S9+ and both listened to a ‘music-audio test album’ and thereafter made a phone call. Both were successful and the audio was very acceptable. The cable is a pliable-plastic, not fabric, so I’ll try to treat it with care. I’m hoping with use the cable will relax and lose its ‘slight coiled memory’, remaining straight. I’ve found with even my Samsung OEM earbuds the fiber cable eventually developed knots and bends. Plastic can be more forgiving. Durability, as I've found, is usually the tradeoff.  I’d be remiss if I claimed these were high-fidelity quality earbuds. But given their very low unit price of under $4, and their in-line mic and volume-up.&.down controls, this makes for a really high value item. While I have quite a few earbud, headphone options, an inexpensive wired earbud set is always useful as an ‘extra/backup’ audio accessory.",5,Al in SoCal,B0D9H9FSL6,2024-07-24

1233,R38CPMOAVQB7NN,Super Fast Charging Adapter With Six (6) Ft USB-C Cable,"I got the 45W Super Fast Charger to charge my devices while I travel, which is rather frequent. The main device that I charge is my Galaxy S22 Ultra and having super fast charging is ideal with the amount of usage I get out of my device.  Build The item comes as two individual items: a Super Fast Charging adapter and a USB-C cable, rated up to 5A. The charge adapter is about 2.05 inches in height and length and 1.18 inches in width, making it compact and easy for traveling. It has 2 prongs on one end and a USB-C port centered on the other. It is light weight and feels solid.  The USB-C charging cable is 6' long which is convenient as the extra length comes in handy depending on my charging situation. At times, I am able to use the device comfortably in bed without worrying about tugging on the cable. A note about the cable being 6', the listing and the packaging calls the cable 5' when it is actually 6'. I had wondered about this prior to making my final decision on the product. Lastly, the USB-C cable is actually firm with an appropriate amount of flexibility where needed.  Usage I unpacked the adapter and cable and removed each from their wrapping. I plugged the USB-C cable to the adapter then plugged the adapter into the outlet. After which, I plugged the other end of the USB-C cable into my phone and watched it light up. At the time of charge, the charge status stated: 56% and 35 m until full. It was getting charged at Super Fast Charging 2.0. It fully charged my device without issue.  Packaging The item arrived in a clear and white ziplocked packaging. The clear window showed the contents of the bag. There was a sticker on the clear window that stated 45W Charger & 5ft (though the cable was actually 6ft). The adapter was inside another sealed plastic baggie with the words TRAVEL ADAPTER on it while the USB-C cable had a clear plastic wrap.  Final Thoughts The charge adapter met my needs as I expected it would. It charged my device in a short amount of time utilizing Super Fast Charging 2.0. I also had the flexibility of movement gained with the 6ft cable. I recommend charge adapter for anyone who may have the need for a super fast charger, especially a Galaxy device. This item receives 5 stars from me as there were no issues experienced at the time of the review.",5,N. Hosein,B0D4QGD3LB,2024-07-07

1261,R2V1BZLRN1WTYZ,Perfection Refined,"An excellent upgrade to an already terrific product. I’ve purchased every CharJen AirPod ear tip replacements they’ve released, going back years now. All of them are a significant improvement over the stock ear tips Apple ships. The differences between each of CharJen’s ear tips is less significant but each iteration has improved on the previous ones and these are no different. I do appreciate that the latest version is white — previously they were black. Sound quality is excellent as usual, and the addition of MicroGrips in these seems to keep them in place better than before. The combination of Memory Foam and MicroGrips keep these way more secure than the stock ear tips, which would regularly fall out during exercise.  If you have Apple’s stock ear tips, definitely grab a pair of these, they are immensely better. If you have an older pair from CharJen, these won’t be a massive upgrade, but ear tips do wear out and should be replaced sooner or later — and these are the best one’s yet.",5,Steve Grenier,B0D5RHRD2D,2024-07-25

I regularly clean the AirPod tips when I remove them from my ear with some sort of cleaning wipe or if unavailable a napkin, so those tips were actually still in really good condition. The medium size tips were perfect for my ear canal and I could wear them until the batteries run out without feeling any pain or discomfort. These tips did a great job at insulating the sound of what I’m listening to and made a good seal the block sounds from the outside when needed.Awesome upgrade!",5,Wakadoo,B0D5RHRD2D,2024-07-24

They have been marketing the new ""microgrips"" as if its some new design that keeps them in place, but in reality its just the same silicone outer shell.  There is nothing there that I would consider a ""grip"".  Honestly I think you should explain this one or just tell people that its the same thing with maybe different chemical composition or something.  I read the specs on the site and it doesnt mention anything about what exactly the new features do.",3,talones,B0D5RHRD2D,2024-07-23
1264,R2OROF5P33W42X,Great fit and feel,"The silicone outer layer makes for a very comfortable feeling while in your ear. You still get fantastic memory foam, the fit is great, and the bass sounds more dynamic compared to my other ear tips for the AirPods Pro. If you have issues with AirPods Pro falling out your ears, I highly recommend giving these a try",5,Shirley D,B0D5RHRD2D,2024-07-25
1265,R6FDQXZTCJ5H7,Feels comfortable and secure,Received these earlier today. Very easy to put them on the airpods pro. The medium sized one provided the most comfortable and secure fit for me. The secure fit also isolated other sounds that were not being filtered out with my old ear tips. Hope these tips last,5,AJI,B0D5RHRD2D,2024-07-24

1267,RRIVIOQTKB4FE,Great fit and comfort - best of both worlds,"Great fit, very comfortable. The silicone exterior and memory foam interior get the best of both worlds of fit and non-slip. I have large ears that most ear tips slip right out of, but these are very stable.",5,Amazon Customer,B0D5RHRD2D,2024-07-21
1268,R30OJU0549456C,Comfortable - Stays Put - Passes Ear Tip Fit Test,"These Ear Tips are comfortable, they stay put during a long run, and they pass the ear tip fit test.  What more could you want?",5,TGABTG,B0D5RHRD2D,2024-07-24
1269,ROZOAO0C2FF16,The best ear tips,These are the best ear tips for AirPods Pro that I have ever tried. They fit snug in my ear and are extremely comfortable with the memory foam inside. I also love the silicone outer casing that is easy to wipe clean. The pack comes with three sizes to find your perfect fit. I would definitely recommend them.,5,TP,B0D5RHRD2D,2024-07-22
