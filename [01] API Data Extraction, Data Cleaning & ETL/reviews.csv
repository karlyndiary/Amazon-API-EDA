4,RVMRL1LZW6UIA,Great Sound for a Great Price,"I opened them and they were already charged and ready to go. I used them for the gym and had zero issues with them. The sound quality was good and the touch functionality is great and easy to use. I’d definitely recommend these if you do not want to spend a lot of money on earbuds,
they are exactly what you pay: a pair of solid, budget-friendly earbuds. The sound quality is decent

These are both cute and functional. If you have small ears like me, you’ll definitely need the smallest tips, and even then I experience mild soreness after wearing these for extended periods, They’re super cute and the touch controls are useful and intuitive. However, there is no volume control on the earbud which I feel is tough if you’re using these to exercise or during periods when your phone is out of reach. There isn’t much bass, but that’s common in earbuds. If you’re looking for bass, I’d recommend over-ear headphones instead. For what I paid, I’m pleased with what I got These have a better case and much better touch controls, though. The fit is good, The batteries in this thing are amazing - They will play a long time without needing to recharge. Bluetooth connectivity is simple and works great. The touch controls are easy to use, Simple taps and double taps on the buds for volume control and track skipping. I can also access Siri with a long tap. You can also accept calls and end calls with touch control.

I usually only choose products with lots of reviews when I shop because I need more real customer feedback to help me make a decision. Next I'll tell you what I really feel about using this product.

It really does cover the entire screenwith no gaps, and the black edges aren't visible on the screen, making the screen protector look like it's invisible.
The installation was as advertised and very easy, which impressed me.
Super clear, vivid colors, smooth, touch sensitive are all as advertised.

It does seem to be of better quality and sturdier than what I've used before. But I'm skeptical about the advertised ability to protect a phonefrom a 10ft drop without damage, which is almost impossible. I've seen almost every other brand advertised the same way, I'd rather suggest advertising the actual height, no one in this world is stupid.

The reason why I would still give this product five stars is because this iPhone 15 Pro Max screen protector is definitely considered high quality and it is better than any brand of tempered glass I have ever used before.

The screen protector itself is top notch, it's very smooth and sturdy, never feels fragile and covers the entire screen while still being compatible with cases. I've had it for almost a week so far and there are no scratches and the colors are incredibly clear. It's almost invisible unless you look closely, it blends in with the screen and it's not too much of a stretch to say it's a second screen to the iPhone 15 Pro Max.(My previous screen protector looks like a fragile piece of glass that has not been processed in any way and has never been edge-to-edge.)

I have always hated applying screen protectors. No matter how careful you are, there will always be bubbles somewhere and the screen protector will be slightly off from where you want it.

37,R1XZZEZVO3469O,"‘Caste,’ an election and the resonance of racism below the surface of liberal, progressive America","Review: Caste– The Origins of Our Discontents, by Isabel Wilkerson, 2020, 475 pp., Random House, original published at Urbanitus.com

As the razor-edged finale to a presidential election riven by ambiguity reaches its conclusion, one overarching reality will endure in stark clarity: the bi-polar, cultural disease dividing America into two angry and unforgiving camps.

Rivers of words diagnosing the malady are fast becoming analytical torrents. Recrimination and reaction to its implications are beginning and will accelerate. As with the companion pandemic that has overlaid this red and blue-hued socio-political plague, experts and historians will parse the origins for generations to come.

The rest of us, meanwhile, can do something more immediate. We can read Caste – The Origins of Our Discontents by Isabel Wilkerson, a book published just in August that reorders most of the prisms through which conservatives and liberals alike think about America in its 244th year. Even if not intended as such, this work of anthropology, sociology, psychology, political science, philosophy and history is a deep well of insight, a primer even, into the dynamics that animated the just-concluded vote, and that will surely animate its aftermath.

Implicitly, this book is also about cities, the spaces where the global issues of this moment are being most profoundly tested, from climate change to shelter to migration to policing. It is also in cities, from Austin to Amsterdam to Abuja, where we might hope that the twisting kaleidoscope of a fast-urbanizing world will transform the divisions of caste into a mosaic of equality.

On one level, Caste is about race and racism, an exploration of America’s original sin of slavery that haunts us today in virtually all of our institutions. But race and racism both have a predecessor that we need to better understand if we are to effectively confront the stubborn and subtle resonance of racism below the surface of so much of what passes for progressive rhetoric.

How can Austin, for example, be both the most avowedly liberal city in Texas and the most sharply segregated? A large measure of the answer might be found in that predecessor of race and racism, this phenomenon of caste and casteism.

In fact, the absurd concepts of race and racism are effectively creations of caste, argues Wilkerson. With this insight in hand, she builds on other recent work, going deeply and broadly into a larger realm that connects our history to that of the anti-Semitism in the 1930s that led to the Nazi Holocaust, and to the millennia old caste system of India that brutally stratifies that country today. In the process, Caste expands upon the seminal work of other recent efforts such as last year’s Pulitzer-winning 1619 Project of the New York Times Magazine, and the new book revealing the sanitization of the 1950s and 60s civil rights movement, The Sword and the Shield – The Revolutionary Lives of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr. by historian Peniel Joseph.

But Wilkerson also takes her readers backwards to pioneering scholarship in the early 20th Century South by the the Black anthropologist Allison Davis in the 1930s and on to America in the 1940s with the work of Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economic sociologist and Nobel laureate who penned the 1944 classic book An American Dilemma: The Negro Problem and Modern Democracy.  Weaving this tapestry of history and globe-spanning research together, Wilkerson delivers her own pioneering illustration of how tribal hatreds weaken and impoverish victim and victimizer alike — along with all bystanders.

‘None of us are ourselves’

“It was in the making of the New World that Europeans became white, Africans black, and everyone else yellow, red, or brown. It was in the making of the New World that humans were set apart on the basis of what they looked like, identified solely in contrast to one another, and ranked to form a caste system based on a new concept called race. It was in the process of ranking that we were all cast into assigned roles to meet the needs of the larger production,” Wilkerson writes. “None of us are ourselves.”

It’s not that Wilkerson neglects the horrors of slavery, or for that matter Nazi evil or Brahmin brutality and domination. From castration of slaves to President Andrew Jackson’s horseback riding with bridal reins made from Native American flesh, to lynchings continuing well into the 20th Century, there is little horror that escapes Wilkerson’s gaze. But it is the subtler and more pernicious diffusion of caste into our relationships, our rules of engagement with one another – and ultimately our national politics – that make Caste indispensable to understanding our own cultural wars and the deepening collateral damage.

“Americans of today have inherited these distorted rules of engagement whether or not their families had enslaved people or even been in the United States,” Wilkerson writes. “Slavery built the man-made chasm between blacks and whites that forces the middle castes of Asians, Latinos, indigenous people, and new immigrants of African descent to navigate within what began as a bipolar hierarchy.”

Wilkerson takes a vivid example from the March 2018 series of bombings in Austin, Texas that killed two people and injured six over 20 days. The first to die was 39-year-old Anthony House, a project manager living in East Austin, killed after he picked up a package that exploded on his porch. Because House was Black, police initially suspected the case might be drug-related or that House might even have accidentally detonated the bomb himself.

“Based on what we know right now, we have no reason to believe this is anything beyond an isolated incident that took place at this residence and in no way this is linked to a terroristic attack,” then-Interim (now permanent) Police Chief Brian Manley told reporters.

Some ten days later, that theory gave way to presumption of a hate crime when another Black and a Latina resident of East Austin, 17-year-old Draylen Mason and 75-year-old Esperanza Herrera, died as they picked up similarly disguised bombs left on their porches. But it was only after two White men in West Austin triggered a bomb by tripwire and were critically injured six days later, and two days after that when a bomb exploded at a FedEx warehouse, that the investigation began to suspect domestic terrorism. That brought in the help of 500 federal agents and the “police now raced at warp speed,” Wilkerson notes. Ultimately police cornered the 23-year-old suspect, Mark Conditt, who blew himself up as they closed in.

Manley did finally label Conditt a terrorist, but Wilkerson asks, what might have been the outcome if the caste-blinded police had warned the public initially about the threat of randomly dropped packages instead of waiting 10 days?

“People can come to disregard the predicaments facing people deemed beneath them, seeing their misfortunes as having no bearing on their own lives, seeing whatever is happening to them as, say, a black problem, rather than a human problem, unwittingly endangering everyone.”

‘The dominant caste around which all other castes revolve’

It is this all but hidden taxonomy of rank and status guiding our actions, in ways most of us are scarcely aware of, that is the great choreographer of decision-making in American and other societies, Wilkerson argues of her research that took her to Berlin to understand the rankings of “Aryan purity” in the 1930s and throughout India to examine the workings of India’s intricately complex caste system today.

“A caste system centers the dominant cast as the sun around which all other castes revolve and defines it as the default-setting standard of normalcy, of intellect, of beauty, against which all others are measured, ranked in descending order by the physiological proximity to the dominant caste,” she writes.

This understanding of caste explains why recent immigrants from Africa have reversed the practice of earlier “middle castes,” say Italians or Jews from Eastern Europe, who quickly changed their surnames to assimilate as quickly as possible into the dominate Anglo-Saxon caste;  Binghenheimer becoming Bingham or Rossellini becoming Ross.

Immigrants from Ghana or Grenada cannot so easily join the presumed dominant caste for the obvious reasons of skin color. So they must take pains to isolate themselves from the bottom-rung of African-Americans, maintaining distinctive accents, dress and names, or in some cases even discouraging their children not “to act like African Americans.”

Wilkerson quotes the late and greatly esteemed Indian jurist B.R. Ambedkar, who rose from his Dalit, or “Untouchable,” origins to become the author of India’s constitution and anti-caste campaigner: … “each caste takes its pride and its consolation in the fact that in the scale of castes, it is above some other caste.”

Which, moving toward today’s political reality in America, explains why so many journalists and analysts were, and remain, blindsided by Donald Trump’s support from working class Whites in 2016 and now. And perhaps it is insight into his surprise support in 2020 from some Black males despite support of White supremacists, or the votes for Trump from Latinos in Texas’ Rio Grande Valley despite the wall, the family separations, and the ugly characterizations of migrants.

“The liberal take was that working class whites have been voting against their interest in supporting right-wing oligarchs, but that theory diminishes the agency and caste-oriented principles of the people,” Wilkerson says. “Many voters, in fact, made an assessment of their circumstances and looked beyond immediate short-term benefits and toward, from their perspective, the larger goals of maintaining dominant caste status and their survival long term.”

And while caste may take its largest toll on African Americans, through unending police brutality, biased outcomes in court, and the world’s highest incarceration rates, its insidiousness leaves few untouched. It is in fact the dictates of caste that lock all Americans into the worst health care and basic education systems of any developed nation and a growing chasm of income inequality that rewards 1 percent of Americans with more than all the assets of the entire bottom half.

In short, our caste consciousness has led us to a point where for some a place high in the American caste system has more value than health insurance, a living wage, political instability, protection from a virus, or threats from overseas.

‘The susceptible group sees itself in the narcissistic leader’

And in a kind of analytical crescendo, Wilkerson brings that dissection of caste right up to what might prove the most durable understanding of the headlines of recent days. For this she turns to the work of Eric Fromm, the late German Jewish psychologist who saw firsthand, and later wrote about, the connection between the pain, anxiety and insecurity of 1920s Weimar Germany and how it fed narcissistic narratives of racial greatness and superiority among the German population that were to nurture and sustain their embrace of a narcissistic leader.

“The right kind of leader can inspire a symbiotic connection that supplants logic,” Wilkerson argues. “The susceptible group sees itself in the narcissistic leader, becomes one with the leader, sees his fortunes and his fate as their own.”

She quotes Fromm himself, who fled the Nazis to the United States and who died in 1980: “The greater the leader, the greater the follower… The narcissism of the leader who is convinced of his greatness, and who has no doubt, is precisely what attracts the narcissism of those who submit to him.”

A single book will hardly resolve the ancient hatreds and divisions of caste and all the destruction they have wrought. A single election, whatever the outcome, will hardly heal the fears and resentments of a dominant caste that have created a society turned against itself. But without the promise of both, as wildfires burn, glaciers melt and cities erupt in violent standoffs, hope for the species seems slight.

38,R2ZI2DAQHW05PO,What is still missing,"This is a wonderful book, well-researched and beautifully written. But like all complex statements, it is not comprehensive enough. There are important topics that must be included in order for the author’s claims to be fully  substantiated, and the most important one is the concept of COLOR as the foundation of American untouchability, and the fact that color as the measure of untouchability was introduced, both in India and in America, by the same white Anglo-Saxon forces that established themselves as the superior caste in both continents. The author mentions the Anglo-Saxons only twice, and there is no separate entry for them in the Index. In fact, there is very little research on the fact that this particular group of people, the Anglo-Saxons, seem to have a special animus against people of dark complexions. They are the only ones who discriminate against blacks in both India and America. The Spanish didn’t, the Portuguese didn’t, the Belgians didn’t, the Germans didn’t; only the British Anglos-Saxons did, and with a vengeance. Why? This fact must be researched for the author’s thesis to be conclusively established.
 The second item is also a matter of fact. While untouchability did, indeed, exist, it was sometimes violated with impunity. This happened often in India among Christians, and in America, among the white owners who raped their black women slaves and did not feel polluted thereby, nor was their superior status diminished. Some research should be devoted to this fact, for, after all, Thomas Jefferson loved Sally Hemmings and did not considered himself polluted by their relationship.
 I arrived in India in 1951, four years after Indian Independence from Britain.  As a foreigner, I would have been untouchable, but the Indian Constitution banned untouchability. I dined with mahârâjas and shook Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru’s hand. Ambedkar’s mission was in full force then, but untouchability still reigned in the villages, as it still does, more than seventy years after Gandhiji said, “I’d rather that Hinduism died than that untouchability survived.”",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ZI2DAQHW05PO,Ignacio L.

39,R2LDYQAASNAY9M,An Imperfect but Immensely Valuable Book,"To the old adage ""never just a book by its over,"" I add ""never judge a book by its first ten pages."" Isabel Wilkerson begins her book by discussing the political ascendancy of Donald Trump, and rehashing some of the oft-repeated but largely untrue accusations about him that I thoroughly debunked in my book Trumped-Up Charges!.

https://www.amazon.com/Trumped-Up-Charges-Mexicans-Rapists-Criminals/dp/B087L8B6GB

I assumed there would be other incorrect information throughout the book, but I was happy to be wrong.

First, Wilkerson is evidently a gifted and compelling storyteller. As much as I hate long reads (this one's about 400 pages), she kept me interested throughout.

This is a fantastic book for anyone who thinks the race problem in America was cured the moment Barack Obama was elected president.

But even an old dog like me, born and raised in a multiethnic neighborhood in NYC, learned a few new things. For instance, I never before realized the extent to which other ethnic minority immigrant groups in the United States helped themselves be more white by differentiating themselves from black Americans.

Wilkerson does make some leaps: she thinks Obama was elected because his is not a traditional African-American story. Not so. Colin Powell's was, and he would've been elected in a landslide in 2000, had he chosen to run.

42,R1YOZ541ZSH6YZ,There is much here to be learned,"It seems we live in a caste society.  This is the message of ""Caste: The Origins of our Discontent"" by Isabel Wilkerson, a Pulitzer Prize winning author.  She cites a number of sources to support her thesis, the most compelling by historian Nell Irvin Painter, who says simply and succinctly: ""Americans cling to race as the unschooled cling to superstition.""  The author also makes the point that racial prejudice is not healthy.  Indeed, she cites clinical evidence that harboring racial hatred can shorten your life, and ultimately kill you.  At 388 pages the book is not overly long, and reads quite well.  However, as well as the author makes her points, she often overstates the case, with repeated stories that after awhile become tiresome.  Having said that there is much here to be learned, and I recommend the book heartily.

Certainly, our nation has been long divided over race, dating back to 1619, when the first slave ship made port in Point Comfort, Virginia, and unloaded about twenty chained Africans, destined for slavery.  Up to this point the concept of ""white"" and ""black"" people was unknown.  The colonies were comprised of Europeans (mostly Englishmen) who did not think of themselves as white. And the arriving African slaves did not think of themselves as black, but as Igbo. Yoruba, Ewe Akan, and Ndebele.  White people and black people were concepts that developed over time.  Writes the author: ""There developed a caste system, based on what people looked like, an internalized ranking, unspoken, unnamed, unacknowledged by everyday citizens even as they go about living their lives adhering to it and acting upon it subconsciously to this day.""

She adds, ""Caste is not a term often applied to the United States.  It is considered the language of India or feudal Europe.  But some anthropologists and scholars of race in America have made use of the term for decades.""  Indeed, the idea of ""race"", is a recent phenomenon in human history.  It dates back to the start of the transatlantic slave trade and thus to the subsequent caste system that arose from slavery.

The word ""race"" likely derived from the Spanish word ""raza"" and was originally used to refer to the ""caste or quality of authentic horses, which are branded with an iron so as to be recognized,"" wrote the anthropologists Audrey and Brian Smedley.  As Europeans explored the world, they began using the word to refer to the new people they encountered.  ""Ultimately, the English in North America developed the most rigid and exclusionist form of race ideology,"" say the Smedleys.  ""In the American mind (race) was and is a statement about profound and unbridgeable differences (that) conveys the meaning of social distance that cannot be transcended.""

Geneticists and anthropologists have long considered race as a manmade invention, with no basis in science or biology.  In fact, the term ""Caucasian"", a label often ascribed to people of European descent, is a word invented by a German professor of medicine named Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, who was so taken with the shape of a human skull he found in the Caucasus Mountains of Russia, that he applied it to the people he believed descended from there and settled in Europe.

About two decades ago, an analysis of the human genome established that all human beings are 99.9 percent the same.  Concludes the geneticist J. Craig Venter: ""We all evolved in the last 100,000 years from the small number of tribes that migrated out of Africa and colonized the world.""  Which means the entire racial caste system--the catalyst of hatreds and civil war--was built on what anthropologists now call ""an arbitrary and superficial selection of traits,"" derived from ""a few of the thousands of genes that make up a human being.""

In other words, it is based on a lie.

As slavery took hold in the Southern colonies, slaveholders began looking to the Bible for justification of their ""peculiar institution"" and, while conveniently ignoring Jesus's Sermon on the Mount, turned their attention to the Old Testament and learned that back in the Middle Ages some interpreters had described Noah's son, Ham, as bearing dark skin, and thus translated Noah's curse against him as a curse against the descendants of Ham--against all humans bearing dark skin.

They took further comfort from Leviticus, which exhorted them, ""Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have, shall be of the heathen that are around you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.""  They took as further license to enslave those they considered religious heathens, to build a new country out of the wilderness. Thus, a hierarchy evolved in the New World they created, one that set those with the lightest skin above those with the darkest.

""The curse of Ham is now being executed upon his descendants,"" wrote Thomas Cobb, a leading Confederate and defender of slavery.  ""The great Architect had framed them both physically and mentally to fill the sphere in which they were thrown.  His wisdom and mercy combined in constituting them thus suited to the degraded position they were destined to occupy.""

Writes the author: ""The United States and India would become, respectively, the oldest and the largest democracies in human history, both built on caste systems undergirded by their reading of the sacred texts of their respective cultures.  In both countries, the subordinate castes were consigned to the bottom, seen as deserving of their debasement, owing to the sins of the past.""

It would take a civil war, the deaths of three-quarters of a million soldiers and citizens, the assassination of a president, Abraham Lincoln, and the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment to bring an end to slavery in the United States.  Still slavery would live on in a new form of discrimination--white supremacy.

The white supremacists devised a labyrinth of laws to hold the newly freed people on the bottom rung ever more tightly, while a popular new pseudoscience called eugenics emerged to justify the renewed debasement.  People on the bottom rung could be beaten or killed with impunity for any breach of the caste system, like not stepping off the sidewalk fast enough--or in trying to vote.

When Hitler and his band of thugs took power in Germany and focused their hatred toward European Jews, who should they turn their attention to for guidance?  To the discriminatory race laws of the Jim Crow south.  According to Yale legal historian James Whitman, in debating ""how to institutionalize racism in the Third Reich, the Nazis began by asking how the Americans did it.""

PUTTING AN END TO CASTE

Writes the author: ""The caste system in America is four hundred years old and will not be dismantled by a single law or any one person, no matter how powerful. We have seen in the years since the civil rights era that laws, like the Voting Rights Act of 1965, can be weakened if there is not the collective will to maintain them . . .

""Caste is a disease, and none of us is immune.  It is as if alcoholism is encoded into the county's DNA, and can never be declared fully cured.  It is like a cancer that goes into remission only to return when the immune system of the body politic is weakened . . .

""To imagine an end to caste in America, we need only look at the history of Germany. It is living proof that if a caste system--the twelve-year reign of the Nazis--can be created, it can be dismantled.  We make a serious error when we fail to see the overlap between our country and others, the common vulnerability in human programming, what the theorist Hannah Arendt called ""the banality of evil.""

""What's most disturbing about the Nazi phenomenon,"" writes philosopher David Livingston Smith, ""is not that the Nazis were madmen or monsters.  It is that they were ordinary human beings.""

Note: While preparing this review, I came across this quote by Nelson Mandela: ""No one is born hating another person because of the color of his skin or background or his religion.  People must learn to hate, and if they can learn to hate, they can learn to be taught to love, for love comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite.""  Mandela, it will be remembered, was elected as South Africa's first black head of state. Under his watch, the government focused on dismantling the legacy of caste (a.k.a. apartheid) by tackling institutionalized racism and fostering racial reconciliation.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1YOZ541ZSH6YZ,Ricardo Mio,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/35c36d0b-0ab9-41b8-85d0-37c1ab711879._CR46,0,407,407_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on January 20, 2021",True,B0D9JXR3BH,169 people found this helpful,,,
43,R3L0KZSGR28HCD,Aryan influence vis-a-vis India,"This is another good one from Ms. Wilkerson. She writes about caste from the perspective of three countries; United States, Germany and India. I don’t know why she did not include the treatment of Aboriginals in Australia.  Truth hurts and this is a disturbing book to read about the hopelessness and the unimaginable inhumane treatment of Blacks in the US, Jews in Germany and Dalits in India.  While here in America, people of color especially blacks continue to suffer, she writes quite a bit concerning how Germany is presently dealing with the atrocities of the past, but she omits to mention the progress India has made since its independence from colonial rule vis-a-vis the dalits. Yes, she makes fleeting reference to this progress. Today there are around 300 million dalits in India.  Caste in India is complex.  While in America caste is a deliberately imported happening beginning with slave trade, in India it was forced by the Aryans who came in from central Asia.  The tall and fair skinned Aryans, the hardy nomads of the grasslands who called themselves ‘noble ones’ entered India around 1500 BCE  through the Hindu-Kush mountains in northwest India. Before this invasion, a well-developed, prosperous and widespread civilization dating back to third millennium BCE of the Indus Valley in the twin cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro (now both are being excavated in the present day Pakistan) of dark skinned people called Dravidians was already flourishing.  With the Aryan invasion began the clash of cultures. The Aryans brought with them the oldest living language ‘Sanskrit’ which they meant ‘language of the cultured’ and the scriptures called the ‘Vedas’ which they said were god made, (‘shrutis.’) They considered the dark skinned conquered Dravidians inferior to them.  For socio-economic purposes, the Aryans divided the society probably based on the color of the skin; priests, warriors, traders and workers and said they were God sanctioned and through their man made (smritis) book of law ‘Manusmiriti’ institutionalized this caste system.  The first three in the system belong to the upper caste which the Aryans kept for themselves. The last one, the workers or laborers called ‘sudras’ of dark skin were classified as belonging to the lower caste and it is believed that they were the locals conquered by the Aryans. Manusmiriti is very harsh in the treatment of the sudras.  Below the sudras are dalits who did menial work such as cleaning lavatories, sweeping roads, burying the dead etc., were kept outside this system and suffered even more than sudras. Due to the fault lines of caste in Hinduism, three great religions ‘Buddhism’ ‘Sikhism’ and ‘Jainism’ rose in India.  To escape prejudices and discrimination from everywhere including from their own communities, dalits tried to find social acceptance by converting to Buddhism, Christianity, Sikhism and Islam.  Ms. Wilkerson writes about the brilliant Bhimrao Ambedkar, a dalit who fought admirably for their rights.  He was the architect of the constitution of India and dalits were brought into the mainstream under Article 341 of the Indian constitution and listed as ‘Scheduled Castes’ that afforded them special benefits under affirmative action aka ‘reservations’ initiatives of the government they so deserved thereby including them in the Hindu fold.  Caste discrimination was outlawed. Although Ambedkar was a dalit, he was made the first Minister of Law and Justice of independent India.  He embraced Buddhism helping mass conversions of dalits.  Many reformers rose within Hinduism.  The Bhakti movement that developed long ago was precisely to address the inequities in the Indian caste system including those pertaining to the untouchable dalits.  Mahatma Gandhi during his freedom struggle gave the untouchables a new name ‘Harijan’ meaning ‘Children of God’ and brought over seventy million of them into mainstream Indian life.   Any reference to the current caste system in India should be judged from the footmarks of history and the sufferings of the Hindus as a whole under 400 plus years of foreign occupation, first from the muslim invaders and secondly by the European British colonial masters. While the muslims were engaged in forced mass conversions of Hindus to Islam, the British exploited the divisions within the society and bankrupted the country not only economically but even stole the dignity of the people to their advantage.  According to the erudite member of the Congress party Shashi Tharoor, the British rule reduced India from its glory of one of the richest countries in the world to the poorest one and its claims of bringing development and political unity was false. Under the British, India in 1858 was one of the richest countries in the world with a share of 23 percent of global GDP.  When they left in 1947 the GDP was just around 4 percent.  In the meantime to add insult to injury, the caste based society started slowly changing to ‘class’ based society which is still happening today.  Only since 70 years after India gained independence from the British and inherited an empty shell of a once proud and prosperous nation, efforts are continuing by successive governments to address the inequities in the system to rebuild a country of glory and tolerance that it was once.  While here in the US even today Blacks are being suppressed, in India affirmative actions and more enshrined in its constitution are continuing to improve the lot of the ‘dalits.’  The current President of India, Ram Nath Kovind holds highest office and belongs to a caste that is considered lower than the lowest amongst the dalits.  Another dalit K.R. Narayanan was elected as the president in 1997. Despite the fact that officially the caste system was constitutionally abolished in 1950 when India became a republic, it still has major influence in contemporary Indian society. Yes, dalits are still suffering and no doubt more should be done.  But progress is being made to address their plight at many levels.  A number of non-governmental organizations are actively involved to right the wrong done in the past.  Also, there is a noticeable change in the attitude of the younger people towards the dark skinned sudras and dalits.  Many even do not know a thing like manusmriti existed.  However, India still suffers from its cultural fixation with whiter skins. There are deeply rooted prejudices around skin color. But, the Black Lives Matter movement here in the US has inspired debate.  Evidences of tolerance abound. There is a backlash against multibillion dollar skin whitening creams, powders and lotions marketed for example as Hindustan Uniliver’s ‘Fair & Lovely.’  They cleverly rebranded it as ‘Glow & Lovely.’  It is interesting to note there are controversies relating to the invasion of the Aryans.  Many believe that Aryans were indigenous Indians and the invasion theory is is just a myth. Hindering the progress is the issue of conversion.  Taking advantage of the plight of the dalits, organizations associated with Christianity and Islam are very active in converting them to their religion thereby complicating the divisions within the society.  The religions of Islam and Christianity are considered foreign and hence converted Muslim and Christian dalits are not afforded the same benefits enjoyed by converted Buddhist and Sikh dalits, as Buddhism and Sikhism are considered indigenous.  It should be noted that forced mass conversion of Hindus by the Islamic Moghul invaders who ruled the country for over 200 years resulted in the partition of the country with the birth of Islamic Pakistan which itself was further divided thereby giving birth to Islamic Bangladesh.  Hindus in India are very much concerned about the possibility of further partition based on religion and are therefore paranoid of conversions.  For the benefit of the readers, I wish Ms. Wilkerson devoted some space in the book concerning the history and these efforts in India just as she has vis-a-vis Germany.   For this reason I am giving the book a four star.  I hope Ms. Wilkerson will use her enormous talent and intellect to write a book on European Colonialism that has devastated countries in Africa and Asia for which they take no responsibility even today.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3L0KZSGR28HCD,Placeholder,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2020",True,B0D9JXR3BH,140 people found this helpful,,,
44,R3MHMIODOJ2LQJ,"Epic, breathtaking and consumed my every thought","Fourth Wing was epic, breathtaking and consumed my every thought.  This is easily one of my top favorite books, ever.  This book had me screaming from excitement, gasping from betrayal, and crying all the happy and sad tears. Foreshadowing of what was to come was secretly laced into the pages, leaving us with the feeling of dread that was all consuming. The betrayals cut deep. The friendships were beautiful. The enemies to lovers romance was a slow burn that was passionate and steamy. And the battles were intense and epic. If you love romantasy, you definitely need this one on your tbr!

Violet Sorrengail is one of my favorite heroines.  She was smart, cunning and brave.  She was so easy to connect to and feel all of her emotions.  She thought she was destined to enter the Scribe Quadrant, but her mother changed her future.  As the commanding general, her mother forced Violet to go to the Basgiath War College.  And there she would either survive and become a dragon rider or die trying like countless others. The trials she went through were gutting, and I found myself cheering out loud for her every step of the way! Violet is a heroine that you can respect and love!

Xanden Riorson was someone that was so easy to obsess over. He was Violet's enemy, because his parents had a rebellion that went against Violet's mom. In punishment, he and the other children of those who rebelled had to attend the Basgiarth War College. Yet by the end of Chapter 7 I was definitely betraying Violet, I was obsessed. Xaden was smart, sly and seemed honorable. His subtle banter with Violet was EVERYTHING! So when Violet would follow through with one his suggestions for training, I was grinning from ear to ear. And when he taught her how to grapple on the mats, it was so hot *fans face*. It seemed like Xaden was trying to protect Violet, yet in her world deception and backstabbing were done without a second thought. So while I was under his spell, I still didn't know whether I could trust him or not. I kept whispering for him not to betray her.

This world was fascinating!  Maybe I was putting the clues together wrong, but it seemed like not everything was as black and white as Violet was taught.  All the while, others around her elicited so many emotions.  It was terrifying not knowing who you could trust.  There were those who had no problem killing a threat, or just killing for fun.  Even the grappling was intense, and I was shocked with my mouth left hanging open over how that would play out.  Broken bones were the least of your concerns. So as people showed their true colors over time, some of that made my blood simmer. But at the same time, be careful who you get attached to. Death found some of them too soon.  One especially I still can't handle, even after finishing this book *sobs*.

The dragons in this book were larger than life! I can't say much, because of spoilers, but the conversations and interactions were spellbinding. Also I loved the friendships that were formed between the humans. They were the type of friendships where you knew they would do anything to protect your life. Which is desperately needed since life and death moments were always present. Throughout this story, there was always this charge in the air that left me terrified of what was to come. And it was impossible not to have sweaty palms during some of the scenes or to feel your heart pounding in your chest! Plus the twists and turns were done beautifully! Some of it I saw coming, but others left me with my mind blown!

With the most epic of last lines, this book left us at the perfect spot where we can breathe. For a bit. Yet you'll still be left desperately wanting to grab that next one! With emotions and tensions running high, this was an action packed ride! The dragons, sparring, battles, political intrigue, friendships, and scorching hot and seductive scenes made this book beyond memorable. It had my whole heart in the palm of its hand and made me cry all the tears! Fourth Wing was beyond addictive and will easily become a favorite for romantasy fans!

this book was the perfect mixture of romance and high stakes and the vibes were so spot on. fourth wing is fast paced from beginning to end and will absolutely hook you from the very first chapter. the world building was perfection and so seamless that it never felt awkward and i was never confused about the fantasy world. this is a world i would absolutely love to live in!
i have heard that a lot of people found this book predictable, but i’m personally HORRIBLE at predicting endings so i may have forseen one or two things but i definitely could not have predicted the entire ending for this book and that made it that much more enjoyable.
i LOVED violet’s character so much. her bond with her sister and her friends was so genuine. she is tough and strong willed and is unstoppable, despite her disadvantage (which yarrow displayed SO SO well). i loved her journey and how much she grew throughout this whole book.
XADEN!!!! rhysand has been my #1 book boyfriend since i devoured ACOTAR last year and no one has lived up to the hype since. xaden freaking riorson has officially take my #1 book boyfriend spot with rhysand as a very close second. how can you not love this man?? he is an ABSOLUTE SIMP from violet even from the start despite his grumpy exterior. men who show their love through actions >>>
this man had me literally gasping and giggling like a little kid because of some of the things he did. he was exactly what violet needed. i loved their tension but also how he always believe in her. and the nicknames?? 🤭
the romance was perfection. usually i get really impatient with slow burns, but the fantasy aspect of this book was done SO WELL that i was such as obsessed with the story as i was with the romance. and enemies to lovers??? sign me tf up. 😮‍💨 violet and xaden had the perfect build up between them. and the SPICE?? puh-lease. absolutely amazing!!
tairn and andarna were hands down, the best part of this book. yarros did SO GOOD with described all of the details of the dragons and giving them so much personality. the interactions between the dragons and their riders were so much fun. i loved tairn’s grumpy exterior, his sassy comments, and how protective he was of violet. andarna is so freaking cute and i love her to death.
i could honestly rave about every single aspect of this book but i feel like this really sums up some of my biggest feelings. this is definitely a book that deserved ALL the hype and definitely a book that you need to read, even if you aren’t a fantasy lover.
this book was not perfect by any means. like anything else, this book had flaws but it was perfect to me. i am obsessed. it had everything i wanted from a fantasy book AND DRAGONS!!🐉 i cannot wait to get my hands on iron flame!! this is definitely a book that i will be rereading before book 2 comes out! i know for a fact that this will be the best book that i read for this year.
(peep my 73 kindle highlights from this book because it had the BEST QUOTES and xaden says the BEST THINGS -> may have some spoilers so read at your own risk)

46,R3TAV4YKSC6WNU,Could not put it down,"This is a well-written, easily-read, highly-entertaining book with an engaging storyline, relatable characters, a believable heroine, and excellent pacing. From the first page it is clear this was a book written by an experienced author and professionally edited, something one can no longer take for granted with Amazon's self-publishing service. I raced through this book and Book 2, the Iron Flame, in under a week, simply unable to tear myself away from either one. I highly recommend them both and can't wait for book 3.
The genre is this new amalgam of romance and sword & sorcery fantasy which seems to be rapidly growing in popularity. The sex scenes may be a bit too explicit for younger teens, depending on your sensibilities as a parent, but were tamer than another well-known author in the genre who tends to go overboard. There's also violence and swearing, but nothing beyond what any older teen hasn't already been exposed to in today's culture.
And although I loved both books, the amateur book critic in me found two small, very nitpicky flaws worth mentioning. Both books end on cliffhangers, and while that is common when writing a series, the giants in the field (LOTR and Harry Potter) did a better job of wrapping up each individual book as a separate storyline. The other thing was the author's strange choice of changing the perspective in the last chapter of both books. Both book are first-person narratives from the perspective of the heroine/protagonist. Then the last chapters of each book switch to first-person narratives from the perspective of the second main character. I found this an odd and jarring choice that I hope she abandons for subsequent books (Ms. Yarros, are you listening?) This secondary main character's internal dialogue sounds no different from the protagonist's, and it comes off as gimmicky and frankly confusing.
Those minor critiques aside, these are two fantastic books that I hope spawn many more, and I highly recommend them.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3TAV4YKSC6WNU,A.

47,R1B8HFCJFF2G3M,Totally Captivating!!,"Wow! It has been a LONG time since I have actually felt tension while reading a book. I can read the biggest action scenes at the end of various books and the majority of the time they just don't affect me at all - because I don't care that much about the characters. But THIS - this was different. I felt the tension. And it was real. Plus the author is very willing to kill characters so there is some uncertainty there as well. And the battle at the end of this most excellent book - it was hot and raging. Plus the enemy leaked danger as well. True menace. Very rarely does some enemy in a book impress me at all but this one most certainly did.. Right from the description I just KNEW there was something different about these mages called venin. They seemed impressive too. And very memorable. I wanted to draw them based off of the description. Very rarely do I get that urge.

But what a battle at the end! It was touch and go. What would happen? Would the heroes win or lose? I didn't know. And I felt concern.

This book has made me feel things. Earlier it had made me cry - tears of joy.

And the book has surprised me too. The plot twists! I guess I should have seen it coming but I didn't so I was quite surprised. But it certainly makes the story way more interesting! And I am certainly eager to read the sequel too! This is a massive book and worth reading every word! And rarely do I feel that way. But its exciting and the characters face so many challenges. And there is death too. In fact there is a lot of death in here. Its a very violent world, a tough world of dragons and griffins and things that are supposed to be only legends to scare kids to eat their vegetables...

But what I love the most in here in the main character Violet. She has a connective tissue disorder. I have one too (its called Ehlers Danlos Syndrome - EDS - and I am pretty confident that Violet actually has EDS). I have never run across a character in a book before that has EDS. And certainly not one that is bold enough to be in a fantasy world where she rides a dragon. How cool is that? So yes I certainly can relate to her very well! And so much of the stuff in here is quite accurate too. Exercise is the best way to protect the joints (and personally I find diet matters a ton too). And yes it certainly can make many things way harder. The joints are all wonky and they naturally hyper-extend so doing things - even just balancing - is way harder. But riding a dragon!!! I remember when I was much younger I used to read this other very popular fantasy series that included dragons and I used to try to imagine what it would be like to ride a dragon. Of course I never thought about the issues of staying ON said dragon... But since I ride horses these days I have a better idea of some of the issues. But wow this book is totally AMAZING! it totally captivated my attention. The first evening I started it I got 50% through. And I certainly would have powered through the second half yesterday but unfortunately I have packing to do as I am moving at the end of the month.

If I could I would rate it 6 stars!

The characters are just so real. And they go through character arcs too. They change. They face obstacles and have to find solutions. And there is certainly a bit of romance in here too. The story moved so smoothly. Never a dull moment at all. None. And I just loved the first person writing in here from Violet's viewpoint.

But the story is about a young woman named Violet who has been forced by her very powerful mother to become a dragon rider. That is a warrior. But her body is weak and ill suited for it. So she was training to be a scribe (but all of that writing would be a huge strain on her too - in fact I cannot write very long at all by hand anymore without pain + numbness going down my arm and I get horrid shoulder pain) but that changed - she had to go be a dragon rider or die trying. But its not that easy in fact its very dangerous. Most people who try to become a rider end up dead. And you can be killed by your own classmates! Yes, its a very brutal school. And after all of these difficult obstacles - which Violet is ill suited to pass - she has to hope that a dragon will pick her. But what dragon will pick someone with a body that doesn't work right due to genetic mutations?

And all of that is near the beginning of the book! For a huge mysterious and dangerous problem is brewing in the Kingdom! And poor Violet will run smack into it - err - fly into it. If she can stay on the dragon that is...

You definitely should read this!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1B8HFCJFF2G3M,Sarah B,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2024",True,B0D923QDHR,142 people found this helpful,,,
48,R3OIM5W64IJ60U,A little to predictable,"So imagine you get dressed up your finest clothing and you’re going to go out to one of the expensive restaurants in town. This restaurant is not cheap it cost more money than the average run of the mail place, but it’s supposed to have superior food.  You get there you have an appetizer you have a meal you have a dessert and you leave feeling like it was average.  That’s how I feel after I read this book. It was just average. Don’t get me wrong. There were some good parts to the story. The beginning was good. The end was good, but there was far too much predictability. I really felt like having I read this sort of similar dragon rider tale before or have I seen these plot points touched upon before.  I could see where certain things were going well before they got there. Not that I predicted everything but too much of this was predictable.  No I did not want to give the book 3 stars so I didn’t go that low, but it deserves about 3.5 stars to be honest.  For the $14.99 I paid for this book digital on Kindle. It cost too much for the story I got.  Here’s the funny thing. I actually want to read the next book in the series. It’s not that it’s a bad story but for $15 it should be a great story and so far it’s just average. There is room for improvement. the characters are nice. I can see this growing into something better but this first book Was not a Homerun.

Message to the author

Spoilers follow warning. Once again, spoilers be warned.

I always write a message to the author when I read a book that is interesting to me. Now I am a fan of the dragon writer genre. I’m a fan of fantasy and LITRPG books so I can get down with any story and I look for the good ones. I saw the reviews I saw the price and I was willing to pull the trigger and pay $15 for this story. I believe authors should be paid properly for their work. I’m a little sad to say the $15 I paid for this digital book doesn’t quite live up to my expectations. The plot was easy to follow. The grammar was perfect and spot on no misspellings. Nothing like that instead I found the story just predictable. It was easy to see who the heroin would bond with. Wow there’s a big dragon she’s going to be with him. It was unexpected that she would get two dragons. There’s a mysterious rebel that wants her dead. I bet they’ll end up a couple. Guess what it happened.  Now the end was not as predictable. I know some people who would’ve thought it was predictable to see him leading a rebellion with the griffins, but I didn’t see that coming perhaps because I wasn’t looking for it, but I didn’t know what would happen at the end truly. However, it was easy to see that her mind had been read as soon as I realized he touched her. I said Dain knows something he shouldn’t. It was easy to see he would be the one to break her trust and do something he shouldn’t. It was also clear someone would die and the only question was would it be Liam or her gf?  The world was a nice world to be in. The characters were nice characters to read about, but they were just too predictable.  One final note the love scenes were well written often I read authors who don’t know how to describe passion in a book, but this was very tasteful. What was repetitive were the feelings that kept being repeated over and over and over and over again. There’s only so many times I want to hear how attracted she is to him. Even when we were given a different mindset at the end of the story man I already knew how attracted he was to her. I didn’t need to hear it so many times it was just too much. I realized they are young teenagers who really want each other, but I don’t need to hear it every five minutes in the book.

I’m a bit unsure if I will purchase the next book in the series, I definitely want to read it since that final scene in the book occurred but I’m a little scared to pay $15. I think the prices for this series needs to be adjusted.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OIM5W64IJ60U,jermel purse,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2024",True,B0D923QDHR,,,,
49,R1B8QV3CJCLJ0Z,I can’t believe I waited so long to read this epic book,"Guys. I’m not lying here: 2023 is MY YEAR for reading. I cannot tell you how many books I’ve read that have been so astonishingly beautiful and amazing and overall top tier. This novel is no exception.

Coming into this book, I wasn’t sure what to expect. The only other book I’ve read by Rebecca Yarros is The Things We Leave Unfinished. Also amazing, but if you’ve read it you know it’s on a completely different playing field than this book. I mean, Fourth Wing is on a different world and isn’t a historical romance novel. It is epic, though, and I’m not using that word lightly.

Fourth Wing is a fantasy novel set in the world of Navarre where dragons, griffins, and magic are real. If you’ve followed a majority of my reviews on my blog, you know that I hardly ever review fantasy novels. I honestly think the only other fantasy novel I’ve reviewed was The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue, which honestly was a real world fantasy, so wasn’t that far outside of my realm. With that being said, this book is outside of my typical comfort zone but holy hell did I love it. Now I’m thinking I’ve been missing out on all of these amazing fantasy novels and I might just go on a binge.

So, what exactly did I like about this novel? Everything. But to break it down: the world building that went into writing this is absolutely insane and makes it an amazing read in itself; the characters that don’t necessarily make you think “oh this again” with the main heroine; the unbeatable plot; and the beautiful, comical writing style that Rebecca Yarros demonstrates.

The world building speaks for itself, but the characters that don’t follow typical patterns particularly made me like this novel. For instance, our main heroine, Violet, is way weaker than other riders. She doesn’t fit the mould. While this is typical for our main character, what follows isn’t. Instead of her beating all odds and becoming the strongest rider of all, she basically just… adjusts. She has to do things differently and doesn’t just become a natural born rider. It’s amazing and you’ll know what I’m talking about if you’ve read the book.

The plot is just like what I said: unbeatable. You have foreshadowing, a romantic subplot, tension and high stakes throughout the entire novel, and man is it satisfying.  I’m not sure how long this series is going to be, but I am here for it.

Lastly, Rebecca Yarros’ writing style in this novel is nothing short of spectacular. You get epic battle scenes, romantic moments that play with your heart, and comical snips that make you laugh out loud. It really does have everything and I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire novel.

Overall, this review is huge but I had a lot to say. I honestly can’t even point to something that I disliked about this novel, which just goes to show you how much I loved it and how great I think it is. If you enjoy fantasy novels, you’ll fall in love with this book. If you don’t enjoy fantasy novels? You’ll still fall in love with this book. I’ve already recommended it to my book club, my mom, and my brother. Y’all are welcome.

50,R3CV2Q9A1VRSWI,Gave me an amazing book-hangover!,"I inhaled this book, it was so good! I know people have a lot of opinions about this one. Some people I saw complaining about the lack of world building, but I didn’t see that. I felt that there was world building, it’s just alongside a fast moving plot. And no, it’s not as detailed as some fantasy novels. Other complain that it’s just a mashup of divergent and hunger games. I definitely see that, but I have no problem with it. I loved both those series (except the ending of divergent, which was not ok), and I enjoyed reading something with a similar vibe.

The characters were lovable and complex. The spice was spicy, but didn’t take over the plot like in some spicy books. I really enjoyed reading this book and it gave me the great rush and book-hangover that comes from being completely absorbed in a good book. ☺️

My only issue was with the disability representation. I loved that the main character has a disability, but I felt like it was only incorporated when it was interesting or convenient. She’s very fragile, and yet she never has bad days, and the spicy scenes are intense and somewhat violent, and yet she has no problems with it, isn’t accidentally injured. That seemed somewhat unrealistic.

51,R31AUW1SOGRSNI,"So Much Cringe, But High Entertainment Value","""You turned oranges into a weapon, Violence?"" - Xaden Riorson

High fantasy, dragons, and an enemies-to-lovers romance in a world wrought with war? YES PLEASE! Okay, let's start at the beginning, the part before I even start reading the book. Fourth Wing is everywhere: Bookstagram, BookTok, everyone and their mother AND brother have read Fourth Wing. I was interested. I had been putting it off for fear that it would disappoint. Well...when I started reading, I was thinking ""Yeah, a nice new young adult fantasy with dragons. I hope it's as good as Eragon!"" Yes, I know I know...I found out very quickly that this is an adult fantasy and definitely NOT young adult. I could tell by the type font and layout, as if the sexuaI innuendos weren't enough right from the get-go! And man...were some of then so cringy. What force on this planet made me even think it was young adult?! 

Some of the innuendos and just the bickering, bantering type of dialogue was so cringy and awful that I had to read parts aloud to my husband for a serious laugh. It was like twelve-year-olds who have heard about $ex but haven't experienced it trying to talk about it. It was awful. Cringy. So terrible that I was affronted that I was still enjoying the book! One of the lines I remember most was something like ""I want to climb him like a tree."" Okay. I get what she means...but if you picture that particular simile...what DOES that even mean? There were better choices out there than...a tree...🤦‍♀️

Cringe aspect incoming: While I love a good enemies-to-lovers trope, in fact one of my favorites, the way this was set up made the characters feel flatter than paper. We have our main character, Violet, whose small size is constantly emphasized for a good portion of the novel. Yes, thank you for telling us for the FORTIETH TIME that she is small and petite. Point taken. Cool. She is also warned early on about the traitor son, Xaden Riorson, who from the moment he sees her, emphasizes his need to kill her. Except...every time he has the chance, there's some dumb excuse as to why he didn't. And then all of a sudden, he's saving her from death MUTIPLE times, and then they are kissing. ⚔️ This is all well and good, or would be, IF there was more to the enemy aspect. There should have been more time taken to explore Xaden's own hatred of Violet, and vice-versa.

At least it gets better. After about halfway through the book (roughly page 250), the cringe isn't there anymore. It's like the author became a better writer AS she was writing. The (human) characters finally started getting some dimension to them, and the cringe-worthy dialogue (with one exception about measuring size, though it's placement wasn't too bad) was no longer present. We finally get a little bit of Xaden's hatred-turned-passion toward Violet, but still not enough to see why he would want to kill Violet, as opposed to attempting to kill her mother, the main responsible party for his misery, instead. I know there will be more books to explore this later, but to make the true enemies-to-lovers feel, and for it to feel genuine, there should have been a bit more from the start. 

What truly makes this book shine is the dragons. Absolutely everything about the dragons. The series is named after their mysterious governing council (or what it is perceived as, though may be something else entirely), the Empyrean. The dragons are intriguing characters who all deserve more page time, especially Andarna and Sgaeyl, as well as the secondary characters dragons, which we don't get to see a whole lot of. With the dragons having their own governing system and being respected as the highest of beings, they certainly deserved more. The dragons also channel magic into their riders, and each rider manifests their own unique power based on their inner self. The magic system is enjoyable and works well for this world.

There are two parts about the book that absolutely make it phenomenal: Threshing, and the last 50 pages of the novel.

Threshing is the day when riders get to go out into the field and try to bond with a dragon. The dragon must pick the rider, of course, and not the other way around. No spoilers, but this scene comes somewhere between pages 120-180ish and is the part of the novel that truly had me hooked. I couldn't put it down! 

The last 50 pages of the novel are the exciting battle one waits for in this kind of book. Once again, no spoilers, but with references throughout and the multiple reveals during this stretch of reading make for an action-packed cliffhanger ending making the reader itch for more. I don't even know where this story will go from here. I know whatever happens, I'll be along for the ride and I know I'll have my wildest imaginings blown out of the water.

Final consensus:  ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐💎
Why? Overall, the entertainment value of this novel has great sway in my final rating. Despite complaining about cringey aspects, they offered great laugh-out-loud moments. Despite the flat characters at first, they definitely fill out a bit more later, and the thing is, one can't hate on that. It's only the beginning of the story (my understanding at the time of this blog post is that it is planned as a five book series). That dragons truly make this book phenomenal, and everything about the last 50 pages really brought this novel to become something more, to put forward the promise to an exciting war story with its fair share of romance...and loss. Yes...I even teared up a bit at one part. No matter what anyone tells you about the book, its entertainment value makes for a FIVE STAR DIAMOND of a novel... i.e. a MUST READ for all fantasy lovers and seekers of a top-tier book with dragons.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31AUW1SOGRSNI,Terri,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/2614cef0-eebf-41de-b416-7bfc4f0dc224._CR48,0,403,403_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2024",True,B0D923QDHR,15 people found this helpful,,,
52,RMLG5BBD2CJAQ,I NEED THE SEQUEL RIGHT MEOW!,"John Palladino, author of the grimdark fantasy series, The Tragedy of Cedain, picked this book for me to read. He said he'd heard a lot of people say good things about it, but the people he trusted absolutely hated it. He wanted to know what I thought. So here we are.

What do I think? I started this book and became obsessed. For the three days it took me to read it, I was either curled up in my chair physically reading it or suffering through the audiobook when I had to actually get up and function as an adult.

I would recommend reading this one physically, if possible. I had the good fortune to land both FOURTH WING and IRON FLAME in hardback during a sale in recent months. As is my habit, I checked out the audiobook from my library so that I could pair the two together. Rebecca Soler is the narrator and I did not enjoy her narration at all. Well - there is one exception - during certain scenes, Soler did match the pacing of the scene with her narration, and infused it with emotion that I felt truly captured the intensity of the moment. So there's that.

I loved so many of the characters in this story. Even though the book description warned me that the only way to leave this war college was to graduate or die, I still fell in love with these kids and rooted for them to conquer each challenge faced and survive to the end. It may surprise you fantasy readers out there to know that I favored the human characters over the dragons in this book. Don't get me wrong - the dragons were magnificent and I loved learning the little bits of history they shared and most especially loved learning about their magic and how it changed, based on their chosen Rider. It's been two days since I finished the book and I'm still in the horrible throes of a book hangover. (Thank goodness I already have the next book on hand to start soon!)

What I loved most about FOURTH WING was the setting. Even though there were a few deaths - one in particular - that devastated me, I wouldn't change a thing. This war college where young adults enter with the intent to become a Dragon Rider had a staggeringly low success rate. First, you have to survive the entrance to the Rider Quadrant. If you successfully navigated that, you were officially a cadet. Cadets then began their first year of training where they must survive challenges, training, education, fellow students and even the dragons! Just because you completed everything to a point, the dragons could reject you. (Hopefully by simply ignoring you and not with fire)

I was engrossed with the magic that was bestowed upon the Riders from their dragons. The dragons were able to channel magic through their bond to the Rider and the abilities manifested in different ways, depending on the Rider. Who the Rider was at their core - the kind of person they were - matched their magical abilities. I know the magic in this book was just brushing the surface, so I'm looking forward to continuing the series to see how it continues to build and seeing if the Riders' magic evolves further.

Obviously, this is a fantasy romance, so I feel like I should mention my opinion on the love story between our main characters. I liked it! It felt like the type of romance a couple of young 20-somethings would have, especially in a setting where they literally might not survive the day. It was quick, full of fire and flat out consuming. So many rant reviews I've seen focus on the ""horny dragons"" - I'm confused why people picked out that one scene that only took up a couple pages and what happened between the dragons took place off the page. I mean, how else do you think baby dragons get made?

In closing, I had a great time with this book and CANNOT wait to get started on the sequel. I'm at war with myself because I want to read it immediately, but then I also want to wait a bit closer to when the next book releases in early 2025.

We never have lazy days where we just let the kids watch TV all day, but Husband wasn't feeling well, it was 101 degrees outside, and I was enthralled. So I read every chance I got that first day and read about 80% by midnight. I needed to sleep because I knew that was too much to finish at a reasonable time for me. And I finished the other 20% the next day.

Fourth Wing has everything you could want from the first release in a new fantasy series. You have a flawed leading character--Violet is fragile. Her bones break easily, her joints and ligaments are weak as well. She is short. And generally not physically strong. She is, however, brilliantly intelligent. She spent her entire life training to go to the scribe quadrant. But her mother, one of the nation's top military leaders, decrees that Violet will enter the dragon rider's quadrant instead.

The rider's quadrant is a vicious school of tests and challenges that will end with more cadets dead than alive. Often times the tests kill the cadets. Just as often, the other cadets will do the killing. And what deaths remain are likely from the dragons themselves! Unique schools like this are why series like Harry Potter, Vampire Academy, Divergent, Red Rising, and even Throne of Glass have been wildly popular and universally loved.

And I mean dragons! The appeal of these mythological creatures is fascinating. Perhaps because they're imaginary, we love the different iterations of dragons throughout various literature and media. Fourth Wing's dragons are some of the best I've come across, from the varieties and their discerning qualities to their ability and willingness to bond to humans. Plus, the bond enables a psychic connection with their riders. These dragons are so well done. I applaud Rebecca Yarros for her imagination and vivid depictions in bringing them all to life.

The friends are an interesting variety as well. There are friendships that form almost instantly, those that have spanned entire lifetimes, those that form unexpectedly, and even ones that form begrudgingly. The personalities differ as much as the dragons and the abilities they bestow upon their riders. Violet's older sister, Mira, warns her against forming friendships in the rider's quadrant. Allies are important, but friendship can often be a liability. Plus, when cadets are dying more frequently than surviving, forming friendships means saying goodbye to people who have shared pieces of their hearts with you and vice versa. But Violet doesn't survive the rider's quadrant by following the path others have established. She must survive by her own instincts and her own journey through the tests and trials.

Speaking of abilities, Rebecca Yarros also did an excellent job creating a wide range of abilities since there are so many different characters. None of the signets were too similar to each other. And I loved the intrigue of wondering what new talent would be gifted to the next cadet. She even forms opposite sides of a coin without it appearing to be mirror talents.

The enemies were fierce. We start off with Violet being warned by her sister Mira to steer clear of Xaden Riorson because he will kill her as soon as he gets the chance as revenge for what her mother did to his father in executing the king's justice for his father's rebellion. Violet meets him almost immediately. Nearly the same time, a brutal new cadet sets his sights on her as an easy target to weed out the weak links. Only Violet embarrasses the new cadet, and he swears revenge that he will kill her. And he's not the only person she ticks off during her first year. Xaden is hard to read. He forces Violet into his wing since he's a wingleader. He bounces back and forth between giving her advice that will help her survive, ignoring her completely, and sending others to her in ways that could be construed either for or against her.

Of course, the driving questions are about whether Violet will survive each challenge she's faced with. If she does, will a dragon want to bond with her? At least until you get to a point where you have answers to these questions, and then you want to know what will happen next. I can't reveal those questions to you as they'd be spoilers.

-""One generation to change the text. One generation to choose to teach that text. The next grows, and the lie becomes history.""

I was so disheartened when I finished Fourth Wing and went to go purchase Iron Flame only to find that it wasn't released yet. The unique school setting where the cadets die more often than survive. The friends. The enemies. The romance. The DRAGONS. All of it was exactly what I look for in a series. Now, I will say that once the characters leave the setting of the school and undoubtedly have to face the corrupt government, things have the potential to go south like series such as Divergent and The Hunger Games. We shall see if The Empyrean series can survive the traps that other series before it fell into or will it thrive similar to series like Red Rising and Throne of Glass. That being said, Fourth Wing gets 4.5 Stars. Have you read Fourth Wing? What did you think?

54,R1588QMIT98U7P,Excellent value,"I was a long holdout, sticking to my wired earbuds for the longest time. Then I upgraded to a phone without a headphone jack and decided it was time to get Bluetooth headphones. I bought this item because they came in different colors besides black and white and they were a relatively low price point.  I got them in the bright blue color.
I love the way they look.

They do not disappoint! They connect quickly and have surprisingly great sound!  They are not noise reducing, however the earpieces fit so well in my ears that it makes it hard to hear people or noises around me unless my volume is down very low or I take one earbud out of my ear.

I really like the charging indicator on the front. They charge using a USB-C cord (included) OR by placing the case on a Qi charger.  The cord charges them way faster,  but I like having the flexibility of both means.
I liked these so much I got another set in a different color for my teenage son. I figured if he broke or lost them, they're not a significant cost to replace. (Also the reason I trusted myself with them.)
Of course it would be ME who left the earbuds in a pocket of shorts that I then put through the washing machine.  Oops. BUT I put them immediately into a bag of rice to draw out the moisture. Impatiently,  I took them out two hours later to charge and try again.  They worked! The sound was muffled at first but now that it has been a few days since the sound is back to normal.
I do NOT recommend washing them, nor wearing them in water, but they made it though one accidental washing.
I am super impressed that these things held up so well to my carelessness, and have great sound and functionality.  I would buy these again and would absolutely recommend them to a friend.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1588QMIT98U7P,K.

55,R31Y2KCBASOXLW,Great value for both phone calls and music,"Sometimes I'm amazed by the advancements in wireless and micro technology, especially when it comes to audio. These popped up in an email from Amazon a few days ago. Though I usually ignore those Deal notices this one intrigued me. I have a JBL Everest over-ear headset that I love for indoor phone calls and they're pretty good for music too (though I don't use them that way). I often like to go outside when I'm on the phone and the JBLs aren't convenient to use with a stocking cap, so I'd thought briefly about getting something in-ear to wear under my hat. These were $35 and the reviews were good. I liked that the case wirelessly charges the ear buds, and the case can be charged wirelessly too. My Samsung phone has wireless charging so I already have two wireless chargers and they're very convenient (especially given that the USB port on my phone was getting sketchy). So I figured I'd give them a try. I played a variety of my favorite music. I first asked for Jeff Buckley live music and the first song that started playing as I stepped outside was ""Hallelujah."" I walked around the property listening to my favorite music and before I knew it I had been listening to music for about three hours. I had really only cared about the sound quality for phone calls and whether they would stay in my ears (which is usually a problem for me). They never came close to falling out and they are comfortable. For phone calls the sound quality is very good on both ends. And though they're rated as having a 33' range I walked all around the house and got considerably farther than that from my phone with two walls separating the devices and I had no dropouts. Overall I am so happy with them that after a week of using them I ordered a backup pair.

I have three VERY minor niggles but even combined I wouldn't consider them significant enough to knock off even ½ star. First, I had trouble gripping them well enough to get them out of the case quickly when I got an unexpected phone call. I started leaving them on a paper towel on the table next to me, but it now seems I've discovered the right way to grip them. Second, though they have a voice announcement of which side is which when first removed from the case, I was concerned that I might confuse L and R as they don't appear to have any visible indicators. My solution was to use my fine-point permanent marker to write an L on the left one. Third, one of my wireless phone chargers is a tilted stand that holds my phone at a convenient angle. I was unable to get the Ear buds case to wirelessly charge on that one until last night when I accidentally discovered that the problem was that the case was too small to hit the sweet spot on the charger. I solved the problem by boosting the case up with a pad of mini sticky notes (as shown in the photo).

EDIT (I apologize if I forget to come back to delete my previous review):

None of the above has changed but I forgot to mention that these are NOT good for noise isolation (at least not the way they fit me) but I prefer it that way. I'm a musician and music sounds less natural to me when the surrounding environment is completely eliminated, and I like being able to have a conversation or hear a knock at the door without removing them. Even without a tight seal I never have to reseat them and the sound quality stays consistent (a first for me after trying several other brands).

UPDATE: I've been using these ear buds for five weeks now. I use them for hours every day and they continue to impress me. On three occasions only the right channel had a signal when I initially put them in to listen to music, but each time I put them back in the case and took them out again (which turned them off and on) and they worked normally. I've only had this happen with music and only when I first take them out of the case (i.e. it hasn't happened while on a call or after I've been listening to music with both working).",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31Y2KCBASOXLW,thirst4music,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fvUKyPotL._SY88.jpg'],,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2023",True,B09DT48V16,870 people found this helpful,,,

The battery life is decent, and the number of charges I get out of a single charge on the case is good, possibly better than my Sony earbuds.  They paired easily with my Android phone.

58,R1IUP603OUQGE9,Amazing buds/price/service... buy these!,"Yes, my subject line sounds like that trash hyperbole you get on annoying pop-up ads on your Smartphone! And ironically, it usually has to do with ear buds. There are tons of them on the market, and everyone claims to be the best.

Now, first off, I am just a customer… never got any gifts or money or anything from this company, nor was asked to “click on a review” for a discount or whatever. No… the reason for all this hallelujah chorus, is that I’m really totally both jazzed, and a bit in awe of these earbuds. I think the main mind-blowing thing about them is the price. I mean, I have a bit of experience and knowledge with this kind of technology, and frankly, these days, what “guts” that are needed to be used to create Bluetooth ear buds is not that complex… nor expensive. How company’s like Sony, Apple, Bose, etc. can charge upwards of $300 for these boarders on theft and fraud!

I’ve tried those “Rolls Royce” buds, and I urge you to do the same, and then try these Tagry Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds that are literally 90% less expensive. Yes, they retail for about $35! They come in an excellent quality charge base, are extremely easy to put on, (and have three extra size buds to give you a custom fit), and most important, their sound quality, and I mean crisp highs, solid middles, and bone- rumbling base, are outstanding. I cannot understand what more you would want either using them for talk radio, podcasts, YouTube, streaming movies, or TV, or playing your Amazon Music or Spotify or iTunes playlists. And yes, if connected to your iPhone, you can make and receive calls, and the microphone in the buds are top quality.

Their Bluetooth software is flawless, connecting to your iPhone, or other Bluetooth devices effortlessly. They come with a pleasant woman’s voice letting you know various messages, like which earbud is in what ear, if they are connected or turned off, your volume control (including excess volume warning), etc.
I’ve had these for several months, and have found the charging, which has a bright LED display and shows the individual charging of each bud, along with their percentage easy to read.

And a note on their service. I’ve heard horror stories of folks trying to reach the outrageously over-priced other earbud company’s for tech support, or refunds, exchanges, etc. Basically it’s nonexistent, and when you do miraculously find a phone number to call them, and get someone on the line, you have to go to the UN to find an interpreter of rare third-world languages to understand what they are saying, and they seem to be trained, not on anything to do with the product, but to make the call as useless and confusing as possible, so that you will just give up and throw their buds, and your money in the trash.

Now, I did have an initial problem, after a few months, in that the base charger seemed to be slowing a bit. Tagry gives you a LIFETIME WARRANTY… yes, an actually lifetime warranty, not one of those sham “lifetime warranties”, that corrupt company’s like Hammacher Schlemmer  have.

I had enrolled with Tagry, on their website, to activate my warranty as soon as I received the buds. I called Tagry when I was seeing what could be a glitch in their charging base, and yes, unlike most other companies who hide their contact numbers as if they were nuclear codes, Tagry’s support phone number is plainly printed on their manual, and to my astonishment, I immediately was connected to a good ‘ol American customer service person, who actually worked for the company, spoke English, and made me feel as if I was a long-ago trusted friend. They truly cared, and said they were sorry, and that there was no need to troubleshoot the base, or return it, instead, they would process an order to send me a new one.

A day later, they actually called me back to let me know that the replacement had been shipped, and that I should have it in a day or so, and if not, to please call them back right away. And yes, to apologize again for any inconvenience.  The replacement arrived the very next day. And again, their warranty is indeed for a lifetime, a no questions asked replacement policy. This is how much they believe in their product, and respect their customers.

So, yes. It is insane to pay more than $35 for quality Bluetooth earbuds. Last year, I sent about a dozen of these out to friends and employees, to use for personal use, and for all that Zooming going on… and they love them. And none of had any problems.

I’m sure you have had a plethora of bad experiences in the past few years, what with isolation, and way too much ordering on-line, finding the products you buy to be substandard, and customer service virtually non-existent. And that is why I’ve spend all this time expounding on the greatest of my earbuds. Yes, I have a life. Really. But what a joy to be able to tell a story like this, rather than the kind of frustration most of us are experiencing every day!

Yes, goodness and quality still exist. It’s rare… but it’s out there!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1IUP603OUQGE9,Julius Forte,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2023",True,B09LD1T57H,"2,141 people found this helpful",,,

62,R2ZDNIMKUQXTMZ,Spent the night at the bottom of a p-trap and still works,"So yeah. I don't normally write reviews, but after night I put my earbud through, it definitely deserves it. I was listening to Harry potter for the 1067th time with it while brushing my teeth. We live in a super run down house, so the sink drain doesn't have a stopper. And what happens? Of course, it's what I've imagined happening every single time I lean over that sink. (No, not pennywise speaking to me through the drains, although I have had that thought too.) My left earbud popped out of my ear and went straight down the drain.

There was water down the pipe (which I guess is supposed to be there all the time. Who knew.) So I tried fishing it out with a coat hanger. That didn't work. Then I watched three youtube videos about how to remove the p-trap (that's that one pipe that is kinda u shaped under your sinks) because I was just hoping beyond hope that it would still be there. But you see, I already struggle opening a jar of pickles, so yeah there was very little hope for me to unscrew that p-trap.

Now, this was at 11pm and my man was already asleep. So i wrote a quick and desperate plea along with a declaration of love and a few bribes for him to see once he woke up in the morning. At that point I did not think it would work. I just didn't want it blocking the pipes and breaking my already broken house.

But what do I awaken to? My man presenting me with an earbud. I returned it to the charger, probably out of habit more than anything and saw that it was charging. Weird.

64,R13UJW2E1VACWT,Proven quality!!- Read my story😊,"I bought this in Oct 2019. .....application was not as easy as other screen protectors I've used but it wasnt too bad.  The only thing I could complain is a little bit of a double-image type distraction near the edges that was noticeable when I play online games. I think it's the motion and graphics speed. Regular use of the phone to read or make calls, it's fine. Clear glass that wipes off nicely and doesnt actually smudge up too bad at all. The other day I dropped my Galaxy a10e from a store's checkout counter and it fell face first onto the polished concrete floor and I was scared to peek at the damage. Well, this protector did its job!! The corner chipped and there was quite a large ray of breaks across the top third of the screen protector.  I gently peeled up the left side and what did I see.....a pristine cellphone front glass😁😁  The last thing I wanted to do was replace or repair this phone after just 10 months.

69,R247G1FXO4ZT5K,Not my favorite screen protector,"This is not an exact fitted screen protector for the a10e. I'd pick another brand if buying again.

It has the cutout for the camera and the outside is lined with a black border. When it's applied to the screen you have to line it up perfectly or you can see the border -- there's no wiggle room. It sometimes covers text if you have it set to full screen.

It also leaves a significant gap between the edge of the protector and the edge of the phone. I have a phone case on and the gap catches crumbs and debris really badly.

Also, this does not come with installation guide stickers and is attached to an oversized white backing strip so you have to wing it when you apply the screen protector. Unlike other screen protectors where you can line it up before peeling off the backing.

Overall, it seems pretty sturdy and adhered well, but it's tricky to apply it precisely and that black border on the screen protector gets in the way sometimes.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R247G1FXO4ZT5K,Ashley C.,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2019",True,B0D5QNFDHZ,17 people found this helpful,,,

74,RINYSNHH5YUTX,Great device for making my new car now have wireless Apple Car Play,"I bought this for my 2018 Audi Q5 and was expecting that I'd probably have to return it as I didn't have high hopes. I was WRONG. I plugged it into my armrest USB port out of sight and it took a minute or so to set it up. It takes about 15 seconds or so to connect to your system when you turn the car on, which is fairly quick to me.

This item connects my car to its car play without me plugging in my phone every time I get in the car. I get in and out all day long so to have this saves me a lot of time!  Haven't had a problem with connection or sound. The connection has been fast and automatic. From Waze to Spotify it works like you have the phone connected. I would say that it works flawlessly about 95% of the time, as every so often there's a hiccup in the connection, but it's so infrequent I view it as a minor inconvenience.

The people who comment that it occasionally freezes up or reboots seem to forget that that happens sometimes even when your phone is plugged into the head using. I have not noticed it being any worse than plugging it in. I have had this for more than 1 month with several long and short trips—no complaints.

I've tried one other brand that didn't work, this one worked right out of the box. I verified that my vehicle matched the list of known working vehicles and it works flawlessly. Note that not all USB ports are CarPlay enabled, so make sure you plug it into the correct port. In my Audi both the visible and hidden USB ports are CarPlay compatible, so I love how the unit is hidden from view.

75,R14ER02B4UOCDL,No more wires No more headaches,"I was a little skeptical at first, but this was exactly what I needed. Toyota is pretty behind in not letting CarPlay via Bluetooth.

I'm a nut for taking care of my tech. Last year I was gifted an iPhone 13 Pro for my birthday, and it was a big upgrade for me. I don't like to keep my electronics plugged in once they reach 100% because it's not good for the battery health. I also don't like my phone being tethered in case someone needs to access my phone because I can't store it as easily. The cup holders in the Rav4 aren't that great.

I purchased this adapter and now I don't have to worry about any of that. Battery lasts me a long time. We went on a 10-hour road trip and I was playing Spotify, using Waze for directions, and my phone went from 100% to 40-50% during that whole time. I haven't had any issues and feel that it only takes 15 seconds for it to boot up on the infotainment. The infotainment can get laggy but it's more of Toyota's fault for using slower tech.

I always have my teen help with tech gadgets. This time I installed myself and it was easy to connect in seconds I was up and running in no time!!! The minute I got back to my car after being away for 4 hours… my Apple Music was jamming from my speakers without being inside the car. No stalling for connection to car play.

I highly recommend this small adapter if you want to have the freedom of your smartphone not being tethered all the time.

76,R2N94O8Y4ZAOPA,I always loved CarPlay--- hard to beat Waze Maps and streaming and controlling Spotify,"Our 2022 RAV 4 is apparently the last model before Toyota introduced wireless CarPlay to their infotainment system. After doing some research on an aftermarket solution. I pulled the trigger on this CarPlay adapter.

This Wireless CarPlay Dongle is an incredibly convenient addition to your drive, allowing you to seamlessly connect any compatible device to apple carplay. With a single plug-in and play installation this dongle can quickly unlock all the benefits of apple carplay. We’ve been using it for three months and we’re very satisfied with this purchase.

There are a few things to be aware of: The unit is designed to reconnect to the last phone it was connected to. If only one person uses the car this is installed in, then it’s no problem. My wife and I share the car so we each have to connect to the CarPlay adapter via the Bluetooth menu on our phones when one of us starts up the vehicle. This process takes longer if one of the phones is running an older version of iOS. Not a deal breaker but something to be aware of. Occasionally, the unit doesn’t want to connect to a phone and we need to unplug it and plug it in again. But overall, this adapter has worked great and saved us the hassle of having yet another USB cable to deal with.

I am really enjoying CarPlay to the fullest. Go have one so your can experience easy access to all your music apps like Spotify as well as directions in maps for safe navigation at no additional cost.

77,R3FLG96UUTDVIS,Exceeding expectations,"This CarPlay Adapter was able to connect the Apple CarPlay wireless in my car as advertised. No more cables or wire for Apple CarPlay. With so many other options available, we did research and found this the perfect for our car and the need. The wireless works seemingly and is great to use.

It's small so I can touch it into the back of the console. You would never know its there, and the bluetooth works great connects almost every time.  The Bluetooth connection between my phone and the adapter is almost instantaneous. Pretty short boot up time so there isn’t much delay in being able to use it. It’s been more than 3 months and I’ve found no lag between it and a hardwired connection.

Some other points worth mentioning:
Setup - While this wasn’t a criteria I was tracking/comparing, it is also worth noting how incredibly simple setup was. Just a couple of steps over a couple of minutes and it was ready to go.
Size - this thing is incredibly small. I thought it would be much bigger. I like how compact it is - easily stays out of the way.

78,R3O8Y4NFCA097D,Very quick boot time for this Wireless CarPlay Adapter vs other units,"When the lightning connector on my iPhone died, I thought that I was not going to be able to use CarPlay on my 2022 Kia Telluride anymore (a feature that was, for me, a requirement in any vehicle we purchased going forward).

Thankfully, a coworker informed me that there were devices that could interface the USB connection to Wireless CarPlay.

After doing a little bit of research, it seemed that this device would be the best of the current lot available today. I'm sure devices from other manufacturers are fine, but I really liked the design aesthetics and simplicity of the device. It did not disappoint, either, because it's literally plug and play (Plug-and CarPlay!).

The other aspect that I liked about this device was that, unlike the others, this adapter's firmware can be updated. I haven't needed to do it, and I hope I don't have to do it, but it's nice to have the option to do it, if necessary (I believe they recommend a """"if it ain't broke, don't fix it"""" approach -- only update the firmware if you're having problems). I could only see this being a problem if Kia introduces a CarPlay update in the car and somehow alters the way it works. However, I'm hoping that will not be the case, and this adapter will just keep working, since it worked perfectly with our Telluride's CarPlay system out of the box.

Highly recommended.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3O8Y4NFCA097D,Donnie Haese,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on June 22, 2024",True,B0D9JMXV2B,One person found this helpful,,,
79,R30Q0BKX1SPXNT,Not plugging in your phone every time you get in the car is great,"I love CarPlay--- hard to beat Waze Maps for traffic and police activity. Love streaming and controlling Spotify on the infotainment screen. I hated having to take my phone out and plug it into the head unit for all my short trips (about 90% of my driving) and seldom actually used CarPlay because of that. I found out about these devices on Youtube. There are several manufactures making these dongles. I picked this Wireless CarPlay because most of the reviews described it as having the fastest processor and boot time and least lag.

I've had this for about a month and I'm really happy with my purchase so far. I'd say the device works as advertised 98% of the time. Simply get in your car and carplay is connected within 15ish seconds. Once it's connected you are good to go until you turn the car off. I do a lot of traveling by car for work and this has been a god send. I don't really notice any lag on my Nissan infotainment.

Occasionally the device will get stuck at the boot screen and I will have to un-pair and re-pair my phone and then it works again no problem. This usually solves the majority of issues. Their technical support helped resolve this. I think it mainly has to do with usb ports getting power when the car is unlocked and the door is opened. If you are in and out of the car a few times without starting the car, it can confuse the device I guess. No big deal IMO, this will depend on the vehicle you drive. The only other thing I wish it had was a longer cable. For whatever reason it's pretty short and none of the other cables I've tried worked. Hopefully this is changed in a later revision or update.

I wasn't expecting much customer support when I purchased, but every time I had an issue or question I would hear back from someone within a day with troubleshooting steps/technical info/etc. I would definitely purchase again due to them standing behind their product and making sure customers are taken care of.

80,R23MS0320EJIVY,It's Literally Plug-and-CarPlay.,"I have two other CarPlay adapters for family members, and this unit seems to be the quickest to get up and running. Very straightforward setup in case someone doesn't read manuals etc.

Use the correct cable (standard USB and USB C included) and plug into your CarPlay-enabled USB port and power up the system, and look for a new Bluetooth device. Connect to the new device, it should start with AUTO-, and after a short wait, you will get the 'Set up new CarPlay Device"""" prompt on your phone.

I recommend getting a MagSafe phone/case charging MagSafe Compatible mount so you can just place the phone on the mount and start the car.

This unit is at least twice as fast getting CarPlay up on my car as older units, which is great if you are trying to get moving and GPS running on the screen quickly.

I need to do more testing on Screen Delay vs other units, but first impressions seem a little bit quicker. In one of my other units, the delay is pretty bad, so I end up hitting a button on the screen twice since I think the first touch didn't work.

116,R2AGRB6KPV0OOW,"Amazing, just amazing.","I LOVED THIS BOOK. The first one started a bit slow and like I said in my review, it was a bit repetitive, BUT man… this one was INCREDIBLE. I swear.

“A line that should never be crossed is about to be breached. It puts this entire castle in jeopardy—and the life of your friend.”

In this book we pick up right where we left off in Throne of Glass. Celaena has been named the King’s Champion and she now must fulfill his every wish. His every evil wish: kill this, kill that, and Celaena can’t do anything about it… or can’t she? She’s been told to do anything and everything in her power to uncover the King’s plans and the evil that surrounds her and everyone she cares about. Good think she’s smart.

This book was so, so, SO good. I absolutely loved it. The pace picked up a lot more than it did in the first book, so it was easier to get into the story. The character development was incredible. Every single character had me guessing what they were going to do next and sometimes they turned out to be completely different than I expected. Some others turned out to be exactly what I hoped they would be. The plot twists. OMG. I didn’t see some of them coming!!!!!!! So I was a bit shocked at first, but then realized how much sense they make to get the story going. And this world. Man, this world is just so freaking awesome. Every single detail is well-thought and they are so important to the story. I loved reading every single word of this book.

Celaena keeps being her sarcastic and badass self, but in this book you get to see her in her element. She fights like a true assassin, so she can be scary as hell sometimes, but the beauty of this character is that she’s the combination of a badass woman and sweet girl. She is able to recognize the good and the bad. She knows what side she’s on, even if it takes her a bit longer to come to terms with it. I think I understood her a lot more in this book. I also loved seeing her letting her guard down for a bit, and it felt completely different from what happened before. The stolen looks and stolen kisses. Meaningful words and memories. It felt deeper in this book. And I loved it, because she managed to show her vulnerable side without being weak. Not that I would think that she’s weak, of course.

“But he had no idea what sort of darkness lurked inside her, or what sort of monster she was willing to become in order to make things right.”

Now, let me tell you a little more about the mess this book has made out of me.

I’ve always talked about how strong I am when it comes to picking a boy in the books I read. It’s always easy. There’s always something to hate about one of the boys, making it easy for me to pick one and stay true to that one boy. But this? I knew this was going to be hard. I knew it the moment Dorian kissed her for the first time. I knew it the moment Chaol reacted out of passion and protectiveness. I knew it when I noticed both of these guy’s look towards Celaena. These two characters are beautiful and passionate and just so freaking lovable:

One is pure heart and magic. He’s just sweet and attentive and such beautiful and trusting soul. There’s magic within him. There’s power that he doesn’t know exists yet, but I know he’s destined for good. He is good in all the ways his father is bad.

“He would move on. Because he would not be like the ancient kings in the song and keep her for himself. She deserved a loyal, brave knight who saw her for what she was and did not fear her. And he deserved someone who would look at him like that, even if the love wouldn’t be the same, even if the girl wouldn’t be her.”

The other one is all about protecting those he care about, no matter the cost, all without exaggerating. He’s all about giving them the best of him, and making sure they are ok. He recognizes his mistakes for what they are and knows when to give some space. He’s passionate and trust-worthy. He’s reliable, even when he thinks he’s not.

“I worry because I care. Gods help me, I know I shouldn’t, but I do. So I will always tell you to be careful, because I will always care what happens.”

And I think, no I know, it will only get harder as the story goes on.

Now, the plot. OH MY GOD. There are a lot of things going on and you MUST pay attention to the details. They will show you the way to understand this amazing world and see it through the character’s eyes. Also, we have some shocking plot-twists that had me jumping up and down. Some I expected and some I didn’t, but that’s part of the beauty of this story.

I love all the possibilities this book has given me. There are queens and kings in the making. There is love that goes deep, but even so, it’s still fragile. There are truths, half truths and lies. There are mysterious and different kinds of magic.

I must thank you, Sarah J. Maas. You have created such a wonderful and magical place and characters. Each character and their story is interesting by itself, but as a whole, they manage to fit perfectly. This is definitely the kind of book that will keep you reading until there aren’t any more pages, and it will leave you wanting more.

117,R1F7ANQ5LHQEK3,"Beautifully-written, thrilling and mysterious...","I hereby declare CROWN OF MIDNIGHT by Sarah J. Maas the most worthy sequel of all sequels that have ever been written. Alright, perhaps I don't exactly have the authority to make such a declaration, but the beautifully-written, thrilling and mysterious sequel to the 2012 release, Throne of Glass, is more than deserving of the praise.

I read both Throne of Glass and CROWN OF MIDNIGHT in an (almost) marathon, with only one book in between. I cannot believe I waited so long to start this series! Now that I've read these first two books, I am already waiting with bated breath for the next installment. The wait each year, until the sixth and (at the time of this write-up) final book is released in 2017, will be pure torture, I tell you... Pure torture.

With that said, I guess you'd probably like to know why I love CROWN OF MIDNIGHT so much. I loved this second installment even more than I did the enthralling Throne of Glass, though that feat seemed near impossible at the time I was reading it. For anyone who enjoys good fiction - not just fantasy or magic or historical-type novels, but plain old good fiction - CROWN OF MIDNIGHT is a must-read. In this single novel you have the perfect combination of an original premise, a well-thought out cast of characters that you can root for as well as despise, a clash of kingdoms/enemies and allies, an unpredictable mystery, plenty of romance, action and adventure and so much more. If I had to make a comparison, after reading just the first two installments I can already see the Throne of Glass series doing for young adults (and adults) what Harry Potter did for kids (and adults) in the last two decades.

What did I like most about CROWN OF MIDNIGHT? I'd say the writing, since the book is full of so many quotable passages and is highly ""readable"" for any lover of fiction. The descriptions the author uses to develop her world, her mythology and a history of magic are far more convincing than anything else I have read in fantasy fiction lately. Her dialogue conveys the character's personalities and emotions, while allowing the readers to fill in the blanks and develop our own opinions about their motives. The fact that the author excels in her writing style and skills is undeniable, but that is not the only reason I loved this novel...

I also loved how solid every single element of the story feels. CROWN OF MIDNIGHT takes the introductions to both the characters and the world from book one and progresses those items into a solid story that, albeit fantastical, we as readers can 100% believe in. Actions and reactions roll off on each other like the swell of waves on steady seas. As with any ocean, those waves must come crashing into the shore at some point. In CROWN OF MIDNIGHT that crash comes with such force, at a point when the reader is most invested in the story, that it feels like the waves are crashing against our own heart. Because the author has created such a solid story, cast and world, both the good and the terrible things that happen within these pages are felt and believed in with every fiber of the reader's being. But that's not all...

I'm always pleased when we get to see a romance progress before the final installment. I also love it when enough time has passed that the romance progresses in a realistic way, rife with uncertainty, passion and discovery. The ""love triangle"" that appeared in book one is quickly resolved in CROWN OF MIDNIGHT. But that is not to say that things are all unicorns and glitter for our pair of lovers... This book contains plenty of romantic swoons, I can't deny that. But we must keep in mind that we're talking about a romance involving a hired assassin for a tyrannical king, so things can (and will) go wrong for anyone who hopes for happiness... I love (LOVE) that the romance in this book feels just as solid as every other element of the story, despite its ups and downs.

Can I just talk about the characters for a moment? There are so many within these pages, both old and new. In Throne of Glass I came to like the four main characters, Celaena, Chaol, Dorian and Nehelemia, as I gradually got to know them. While reading CROWN OF MIDNIGHT, my love for (and connection to) the characters just exploded! Trust me when I say that Throne of Glass was a mere build-up to the direction in which each of their lives were taken in book two. CROWN OF MIDNIGHT trumps all. Hands down.

We see so much more assassin ""bad-assery"" out of Celaena in CROWN OF MIDNIGHT. (In Throne of Glass, I just wasn't convinced. But now.... NOW I AM.) This girl kicks some serious bad guy butt, guys. Celaena balances the fine line between good and evil with finesse, but all the while I love where her heart is in every move she makes. I never thought that I would back a killer as much as I do the young and extremely dangerous Celaena, but there you have it: I totally support every kill she makes and would totally take her on as my own personal Champion.

I wish I could go on and on about my love for CROWN OF MIDNIGHT, but since it is full to the brim with surprises and new developments, to say more would be to spoil the story for you.

If you have not yet read the first book, Throne of Glass, you really need to get on that ASAP. For those who are eagerly awaiting this installment, trust me, the wait is worth it. Be glad you have yet to experience the awesomeness that is CROWN OF MIDNIGHT. I'm sad that I will never again have a ""first read"" of it, but then again... I guess there will be at least four more ""first reads"" in this series, won't there?

Can. Not. Wait.

My favorite passage from CROWN OF MIDNIGHT:

  ""Enough! We have enough enemies as it is! There are worse things out there to face!""

  Celaena slowly turned to him, her face splattered with blood and eyes blazing bright. ""No there aren't,"" she said. ""Because I'm here now.""",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1F7ANQ5LHQEK3,Jenna Detrapani,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/21+4HUDvHFL._CR3,0,192,192_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2013",True,B0D96RHR3Q,6 people found this helpful,,,
118,RCQ7GKN327XQC,4 Stars,"Crown of Midnight started off with Celaena being a bit more active in the king's service. Where she finally won the title of King's Champion in Throne of Glass, the King is finally calling her into service to dispatch his enemies. And even though she's an assassin in deed, Calaena finds herself in a tough position. The King threatened Chaol and Nehemia and their families if Calaena doesn't perform up to his standards, but she knows that he is an evil man and will likely use her to simply further his world domination attempts rather than for justice. She has to fight back how she can, but it takes being extremely careful in how she chooses to do so. This means that her friends also aren't in the know because that puts them in danger as well.

Crown of Midnight felt a bit longer to me than Throne of Glass even though it's not really longer, and it didn't even take me but 3 days more to read. I think I felt that way because events were bee-bopping along and I was loving the direction that things were going until about 45% I realized that things were going too well too quickly. And then panic mode set in. I knew that something had to happen to disrupt all of the good things going on with the characters. And for the 2nd time in this series I wanted to seek out spoilers just so that I could prepare myself and not be so worried or stressed out about what was about to happen to these loved characters. I didn't. I did text my feelings to Holly. Thank goodness I could bounce my fears off her and know that she wouldn't spoil anything for me. But this fear actually had me putting Crown of Midnight down more often because I was trying to put off the terrible events I could feel coming for as long as possible.

And of course, I was correct. Things were going too well for these characters. Calaena suffers a major blow which causes a bit of an emotional break. She's been through a lot in her 18 years, and she's suffered and lost so much during that time. I can understand her grief in some ways, but who and how she chooses to lash out to didn't make complete sense to me. Yet, I can see how her actions and reactions were necessary to further the story and plot and her character in general.

All of the characters that I fell in love with in book 1 were just as loveable in Crown of Midnight. Nehemia is Calaena's best friend. She's a princess whose land the King is currently conquering. And she's desperate to do anything she can to get her people freed and not just her people, but all of those who are under the thumb of the King. She isn't afraid to say the hard things that needs to be said to Calaena. That's the proof of a true best friend. You might not always like what they have to say, but it is always for your good to hear it. Hugs and a salute to Nehemia.

Dorian took a step back from his relationship with Calaena. It wasn't entirely his doing, but he was gracious about it. Although, Crown of Midnight indicates that Dorian knew how Chaol felt about Calaena going all the way back to the Yulemas ball in Throne of Glass so one has to wonder why he chose to pursue her in the first place. However, I really came to respect Dorian. Not only in his graciousness, but also in his ability to be there for Calaena when she needed him and could go to no one else. He didn't have to be there for her. He could have behaved much differently towards her. But that's not who he is. Plus he has his own catalyst that will propel him into rebelling against his father that is entirely different than Calaena's. I look forward to seeing him become more of the man I believe he can be in future books.

Chaol was my man from the very beginning of Throne of Glass. He battles his position in being Captain of the Guard and what that means for his loyalty to the King with his friendships with Dorian, Nehemia, and his growing feelings for Calaena. His choices while not wrong do cause some negative consequences for him that he'll be regretting for some time to come. I felt so bad for him through the later half of the book. Yet he's still my favorite.

The villains are present as well. We know that the King is at this point the ultimate villain, but he wasn't even that active or present in the story of Crown of Midnight itself. I know he'll take on a larger role as the series continues. I don't feel like I can discuss the true villain of this book without spoilers so I'll keep that out of this review. Duke Perrington was mentioned but took an even smaller role than the king. Katlain which we loved to hate from book 1 had a small part. Mostly she's just pitiful now. And there's a new character on the scene, Roland Havilliard. I don't trust him. On the one hand, he seemed in league with the King and Duke Perrington, but on the other he seemed to be a pawn in their games/plans.

Favorite quotes:
-&#34;You will never forget killing Cain,&#34; she said at last, and when her eyes met his, his heart pounded so hard he could feel it across his whole body. &#34;But I will never forget what you did to save me, either.&#34;

-&#34;If she picked Roland over you, that makes her the greatest fool who ever lived.&#34;

-...it was the knight's gift, of seeing her for who she was--not what she was--that won her heart.

-But death was her curse and her gift, and death had been her good friend these long, long years.

-Then Calaena and the King of Adarlan smiled at each other, and it was the most terrifying thing Dorian had ever seen.

I do think that Crown of Midnight was intended to end in a little bit of a cliffhanger. Not in the way of withholding information from the reader, but more in the way of giving the reader some important information right before ending and not being able to see what the characters will do with that information. I wasn't particularly surprised by the revelation. The only big surprise for me happened about halfway through the book.

This book gripped me. I was so emotionally invested in what happened and was going to happen to these characters that I've come to love. It just doesn't get much better than that. Crown of Midnight was packed with happy moments that had me cheesing. But it is also packed with heart wrenching and stressful moments. There's action and mystery as well. Crown of Midnight gets 4 Stars from me. I can't wait to dive into Heir of Fire. Have you read Crown of Midnight? What did you think?

119,R3GMPF3T5AJT7Q,Surpasses Throne of Glass by FAR,"*flails* This book was so good. I liked Throne of Glass, but I LOVED Crown of Midnight. (!!!) Watch out below for some spoilers if you haven't read Throne of Glass yet.

Ten Likes/Dislikes:

1. (+) Celaena, the protagonist - Celaena and I haven't had the best of pasts. When I first read Throne of Glass, I thought she was too arrogant - so arrogant that I found it hard to identify with her, so arrogant that I never really believed in the danger that she faced. My wishes were granted, though: you do find out more of Celaena's past, and you do get more into her head in Crown of Midnight. She's still bold and brash, clever and witty, strong and assertive, and yes, quite able to defend herself (and thus proves herself as an assassin and King's Champion)--but where she shines in this novel, it's none of those things. It's when she finally shows some vulnerability, some doubt, some emotion, and that actually made me want to hug her. That got me rooting so much for her that it was nearly inconceivable that I didn't like her before. So if you loved Celaena in Throne of Glass, you will ache for her in this novel. If you weren't her greatest fan in Throne of Glass, maybe you'll like her in Crown of Midnight.

2. (+) World-building - You wanted more on Adarlan and life outside the court and in Rifthold? How about the political system? How about the magic and the King's nefarious plots? How about Elena's history and the beasts we found in Throne of Glass? There's that and much, much more. One of my favorite things about the Throne of Glass series is that there's so much to be discovered in the world, little details about the food and city that give it a different feel besides the usual medieval aspects of high fantasy. These are the kind of details that you can feel and appreciate as a reader but don't have to analyze (though Shannon does quite well in the linked blog post). Yeah, there are some epic fantasy cliches, but they never feel old and too much. Ms. Maas does a great job reinventing old tropes into her own world.

3. (+) Romance - Undoubtedly, the romance will anger some fans as Celaena makes a clear decision in this novel but isn't too tactful about that decision. Personally, I wasn't a huge fan of the non-interest (not just romantic-wise but also character-wise), so while I recognized that Celaena and Chosen One could have done better, I still reveled in the slow-burn that soon came to pass. Most of all, I was just happy that there wasn't the same level of love triangle as in the first book. Both Dorian and Chaol spend some parts in the beginning fantasizing or moping about Celaena but not for too long. And the best part of it is that the romance is one of a few things that forces development of these three characters and fits unexpectedly into the plot. This novel is a much darker, more mature novel than its predecessor, so if you were concerned about that in Throne of Glass, take this as a warning for Crown of Midnight, though I personally think that Ms. Maas was tasteful about both the action and the romance scenes.

4. (+) Plot - Ooh, wow. All the different plot threads of this beauty. The plot improved greatly from the Competition in the former book. There's still the loose threads introduced by the creatures Celaena previously encountered, the romantic threads, the threads of Celaena's past, Celaena as King's Champion, the King's plans and other events that are set into motion by all of the above. So much is happening in this novel, and all the threads come together beautifully. Some of the twists are a bit more predictable than others, but their predictability didn't take away any enjoyment (for me).

5. (+) Character Cast - Nehemia's friendship with Celaena is one of my favorite female friendships in YA. I especially love that it's made clear that Nehemia has her own motivations, her own set of beliefs--a past and a personality before she meets Celaena. Other side characters from Throne of Glass who I didn't expect to be reintroduced are brought back to reinvigorate the plot in unexpected ways.  Some new characters are introduced, though am I allowed to consider a talking doorknob a character?

6. (+/-) Incorporation of Previous Work - Have you read the Throne of Glass prequel novellas? (Side note: they are being bound and made into a print book, if you're interested). If you haven't read them, there are some mentions in this novel that might confuse you (especially novella #2, in the desert). On principle, I dislike the feeling of inside jokes (from the novellas) that you won't understand as a regular reader and figured I ought to warn others of this, though I did think that Ms. Maas had a sneaky and cool way of incorporating the novellas and Throne of Glass (not just the events and relationships and plot details but other details I hadn't remembered until they came up again).

7. (+/-) Themes - I think this is a book that will make some fans cry and rage with its careful exploration of the domino effect of choices and manipulation. The themes of love and loss also come into play a lot more fully in this novel than they did in Throne of Glass. That being said, there was one event in particular that I personally didn't think sent the best of messages, though I'm still not sure what else could have happened to have had as propulsive of an effect on character development.

8. (+) Writing - The writing reminds me of that in Angelfall - not because they're from the same type of POV (they're not), but because they have a similar, cinematic effect that allows me, a non-visual reader, to picture clearly what is happening. There are a few fully-fledged narrative scenes and dream sequences, but overall they were so minor in light of the entire plot that I thought they actually sometimes helped.

9. (+) Pacing - This book starts with action and ends with a bang. There's really no dull moment or unused scene. A lot of things contribute double time towards building the tension for the climax.

10. (+) The Cover - I'm actually a fan of the new covers, though the pose for this one is quite awkward. On the flip side, you have Celaena in a dress, so you get both sides of her and the dramatic fiery colors work well for the book's content.

All in all, Crown of Midnight does exactly what a sequel should do: advances the plot while developing the characters, world, and themes and maintaining high stakes. If you are a fan of Throne of Glass, you simply cannot miss out on Celaena's latest adventure. Highly recommended.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GMPF3T5AJT7Q,Christina,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2013",True,B0D96RHR3Q,12 people found this helpful,,,
120,R3KR5F0QTSAUJM,A great second book,"I’m not sure where to start with this one. I tend to write shorter reviews as a series progresses, unless a book shocks and/or greatly disappoints.

This is the second book in the TOG series, and I am a prisoner of this story. I’m so invested! It’s taking every bit of power (which I DO NOT have) to pick up any other book. I was able to squeeze a Mitch Albom book in between the first and the second, but I’ve no clue how successful I’ll be in my future attempts. I’ve already started reading the third!

In this second book, the plot expands but not as significantly as I would have wanted. It picks up immediately where its predecessor left off. The series of events thereafter are fun, fast-paced, and keep you wanting more. Rather than learn more about its world, this book focuses more on some of its history to tries and help us understand why things are happening. SJM still does an excellent job at making sure we’re well engaged and has shown, time and time again, that no one is safe. &lt;i> SJM is a secret murderer. No one can convince me otherwise. You fiend! &lt;/i>
C remains one of the most fun characters I’ve ever read, and I value her dynamic personality. So scary but so lovable. So prone to getting hurt and she does…repeatedly. &lt;i> Give the woman a break! &lt;/i>
I learned to love Chaol in this book and was devastated, in the end, when everything unfolded. Dorian…eh. I like him less and less. Dunno why.
One place where I feel SJM can do a little better is in creating stronger connections. Despite hating some of the things that happened, I did not feel that C’s reaction was warranted. I think that’s due to there not being enough material for us to feel as intently as C does about other people. I’m more invested in C than anyone else. I’m not even afraid of this terrible, scary king…

I did love learning a lot more about the history of Erilea and am even more excited about the next book. Adarlan almost feels like a rat-infected sewage of awful people and I need things to move away for a bit. &lt;i> Or forever. &lt;/i>

I must commend SJM for her writing style. Some fantasy books spend so much time building a world and the story sometimes gets lost in all this. I enjoy that she does world-building but keeps the story moving. It helps that her writing is very good.

I love this book, but I can’t lie and say that I didn’t see the big reveal coming. I didn’t connect some of the dots, but the *gasp* wasn’t there. It also made me a little angry at C. I get the fear and understand some of the reasons she’d shy away from some things, but ***’s death was hardly the trigger she needed. I would have figured 500 dead rebels or two whole slave camps would have done it, but alas.

I’m looking forward to the next book and can’t wait to see where this goes.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KR5F0QTSAUJM,Willian,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on February 20, 2024",True,B0D96RHR3Q,2 people found this helpful,,,
121,R2HBGREXTUNSU,"Despite a few disgruntled readers, my 10 year old & I love the series!!!","Okay, truth...my daughter is 10 and in the 5th grade. Grandpa, an avid reader like myself, went out on a limb and bought the book for her last Easter. We struggle to find books that are in her 8.4-9.5 reading level, have age appropriate content with a plot she has the life experiences to connect to and comprehend, that are also challenging AND interest her...tall order. We have read all the popular series - adore Harry Potter, of course; tore through the &#34;Greggor the Overlander&#34; series, etc. - so even though in previewing  the series I noticed it contains some very minor-vanilla...no F-bombs or S$$T level, mature-type language, and there are a couple scenes that hint at an intimate relationship in book 2 (trying not to spoil books), I gave the book a green light. We started reading it together, taking turns reading aloud, and were BOTH immediately, read 30-40 pages at a time, wake up needing to see what happens to Celena, come home from school hoping to fit in a read and &#34;see what Celena has gotten up to now&#34; before dance, hooked like I have never seen her before!!! And while she is an awesome reader, she is not, by any means a sit & read person, preferring to dance, sing, socialize, game, etc...yet another challenge to add to the list. The challenged are important to note because the way Maas has crafted the characters has achieved what NO OTHER series has for my daughter, and that is to draw her in to the point she NEEDS to keep reading, every single day. The characters are beautifully developed to the point where my daughter was crying when she thought her favorite character died, and was angry at who did die. Maas has painstaking developed 3-dimensional characters that are ever evolving, and that are relatable to all ages. She has also created an entirely new setting that is similar enough to other books of the same genre, like Hunger Games (she has read/watched all), yet it is entirely new & fresh. The writing is clear & thought-provoking, and she weaves in asides & flashbacks that challenge and engage readers. We have had the most incredible conversations and my daughter has made multiple connections to other texts, movies, life, and especially music/song lyrics while reading. These connections are the reason I personally & professionally recommend  the series to children beginning at age 10 who are reading at a 6.5-7+ grade level, primarily due to the challenging vocabulary. The twists and turns, the co afflicts & themes, character interactions, vivid & selected detailing, and obviously careful/thoughtful word choices make this series, in my opinion, an award winning, best selling series. As a reading specialist and 18 year veteran teacher of struggling readers, I fully give not just this book, but the entire series 5 stars! I could rave on and on...but I don't want to give away a single detail and only, sincerely hope what I have shared has piqued your curiosity enough to give the series a try yourself, along with a loved one, and that through sharing our personal experiences with the books I have helped answer the question of reader age appropriateness & interest level. Buckle up...it's a wild, wonderful ride through Adarlan!
Added info for Book 2...
Please note: I am reading the series aloud with my daughter, so as we go we just naturally, out of habit, change cuss words to &#34;gosh&#34; and &#34;darn.,&#34; and the intimacy scenes were handled as follows: &#34;A., this next chapter has Choal and Celeana interacting like a married couple sometimes do in private. Shall we read or skip?&#34; Reply, &#34;Well, um is it very like detailed?&#34; Me: &#34;Nah, it's pretty vague.&#34; A: &#34;Well, I know she shouldn't be doing that stuff because they are not married, but let's just read it...it's not like I'm embarrassed or going to act like that myself...ewwww!&#34; (Love the sweetness this age!) Basically, here is my point and yes I have one... if you take the time to first, preview what you will read with your child later; second, spend the time to read aloud with your child; third, talk to your child & maintain open dialogue, all the time, about everything, just as though they are the adults-in-training they really are (not saying talk like you are buddies, peers, or equals), the content of a fictional novel is not going to become controversial or be outrageous to them, throwing them into a tizzy of misadventure and exploits! So yes, while, the series is for ages 14+, I still maintain that WITH parental supervision/accompaniment, this is an incredible series to read together!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2HBGREXTUNSU,KPoulin,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on August 26, 2017",True,B0D96RHR3Q,95 people found this helpful,,,
122,RXBRONZKER6VH,SO much better than the first book,"After THRONE OF GLASS I wasn't expecting great things from this book, but Maas has provided me with an incredibly pleasant surprise.  I rate the first one at about 3 stars, and despite it being a light, fun read I was significantly disappointed with the characters and several important aspects of the writing and structure.  Most of those things were largely re-modelled and repaired for this book, and I found myself enjoying it much more from the very beginning.  From the first page Celaena is morally conflicted about her assassinations, and shows consideration of deeper ethical issues. She actually develops and grows throughout the novel! Who'd have thought?

Saying this, the introductory section of the story, in which plot and characters are established, did stretch out for a full half of the book.  About 40% of the way through I seriously thought I'd let myself become hopeful too soon, and was just in for another complete book of the same fluffy dancing around important issues the first one consisted of.  But then about halfway through, the story takes off, and it doesn't stop.

Here, we see Celeana in the role that's always been rumoured but never witnessed before now. Adarlan's Assassin. We see her let loose and fight and kill.  She is brutal and savage and gruesome and it is fantastic.  She is dark and wicked and I loved her for it so much more than I ever loved her flirty or pretty.  It frustrated me when someone was trying to bring her back from the madness; talk her out of the darkness, because in the darkness she was amazing.  My respect for her instantly shot up at seeing her cause ruthless carnage (disturbing as that sounds), because this is the character we were promised back on the blurb of book one; this is the character we wanted to read.  Finally, she emerges.  And perhaps because it was so overdue, it was ridiculously satisfying.

There was not quite so much obsession over the love triangle in this book either, which impressed me significantly.  Romance was a large focus in the first half of the book, but only because it was used as a driving force for the plot events that occurred in the second half of the story, at which stage romance retreated to the periphery and yielded to action.  I was glad that unlike the first book, where it was essentially used as the main plot-draw for readers, the romantic aspect was used instead to support and enhance the plot.  It made for a much more readable story.

Additionally, there's also a lot more in this book on Celaena's personal background and the history of the world, which is all well presented.  The core plotline that one can sense will be the focus of the series entire is further developed, but not so much as to leave nothing for the next books to cover.  In fact, I would say the central plot is only just beginning.

My one concern in this regard, is that Maas revealed everything about Celaena's history all at once.  It made for a great ending and a stunning developmental twist to her character, which would have been perfect leading into the final book of a trilogy, but considering there are supposedly another four books or something to come, I am a little concerned about where she'll go with the character from here.  As mentioned I didn't much like Celaena in book 1 due to her lack of depth and development, and I'm worried that now Maas has unleashed all the development and revelations at once, and Celaena will slide back into being flat and emotionally stagnant for the rest of the series.

But I suppose that's why she's the author, and as a reader I can't but trust in her abilities to continue keeping me amazed, surprised and entertained.

123,R269SEZYXMAP6L,good quality,"This is a high-quality tempered glass screen protector for my Samsun Galaxy S22 Ultra. The clarity of the tempered glass is exceptional. It provides a crystal-clear view of my phone's display without any distortion or loss of brightness. This is crucial for a device like the Galaxy S22 Ultra, which has such a vibrant and detailed screen. The protector is so clear that it feels like there's nothing on the screen at all, allowing me to enjoy my phone's display to the fullest.

One of the standout features of this screen protector is that it does not affect the touch screen sensitivity. Every swipe, tap, and gesture is registered just as accurately and quickly as it was without the protector. This seamless interaction is vital for maintaining the phone's usability and ensuring a smooth user experience.

Installation was a breeze. The package included all the necessary tools, such as cleaning wipes and a dust removal sticker, to ensure a dust-free and bubble-free application. Following the step-by-step instructions, I was able to install the protector perfectly on the first try. There were no air bubbles or misalignments, and it adhered firmly to the screen.

Another important aspect is how well the fingerprint reader works with the screen protector. I was initially concerned that the added layer might interfere with the fingerprint sensor, but those worries were unfounded. The fingerprint reader works flawlessly, recognizing my prints quickly and accurately every time. This was a huge relief, as I rely on the fingerprint sensor for quick and secure access to my phone.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R269SEZYXMAP6L,WinWin,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/630195c0-2c19-4e1f-ac3e-e8c6f90c8a53._CR62,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/611H4qc8gJL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71RqvzqwKtL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71r+eftlioL._SY88.jpg']",,"Reviewed in the United States on June 15, 2024",True,B0D96RHR3Q,40 people found this helpful,,,

140,R1NC63NJ0E4HWC,"Easy to install, printouts look good","This toner cartridge was easy to install in my ancient Brother HL-2270 DW laser printer. I was surprised that the printer's ""Toner"" light stopped flashing after I installed it; apparently the printer recognized that the cartridge is full even though it's not Brother's own brand.

The printouts look fine… except for the little black and white spots, but I was having those before the replacement too, and they got much better (but not completely cleared up) after I ran the built-in drum cleaning routine several more times. I really doubt that those are the fault of this toner cart, that's a drum problem. I may have to buy a new drum too (which I've never done!), in which case I hope I can transfer this full toner cart between the old & new drum without a mess of spilled toner. We'll see. In any event, there was NO mess at all in taking EZink's cartridge out of their packaging & installing it in the genuine Brother drum.

This is only the second time I've bought a third-party cartridge in all these years with this printer; the first time, years ago, was a disaster as it made a mess just taking it out of the packaging! I don't remember what brand that was, but this 3rd party cart was a welcome change -- it basically looked and behaved just like a genuine Brother cart, only it felt more full/heavier (i.e. more full of toner), which is good.

144,R1Y5ERMF8QZ7X4,Puts charge into my S8 quickly,"I bought this a few months ago as 'emergency backup', if I happened to be away from a charging source (so, not in a building or car; generally for camping and the like).  The battery in my Galaxy S8 has degraded over time, and I wasn't ready to get spendy on a new phone, nor did I look forward to 'cell phone surgery' to replace the battery (the days of popping off the case back and swapping out in a minute or two are long gone, sad to say).  So I ordered this up.  At 10,000 mAh, I figured I should get enough charge to get me through a jam.

If you're thinking... ""S8!  That's a dinosaur!""  -- you're likely rocking something much more current, and aren't worried about off-grid power.  Yet.  But remember -- all batteries degrade with time.

After having used it... my thoughts
- Takes a bit to charge up, once discharged (so once you've discharged, plan ahead).  Especially the first time.

- However, once it's charged up, the self-discharge rate is slow, so you don't have to constantly keep it plugged into a wall wart, etc.  You can charge this up, once conditioned, and pack it away for a few weeks to a few months.

- The 4 LED meters on the front are handy for determining SoC / Time to Charge

- Form factor on this is very similar to the dimensions on my S8 (although a little thicker, and of course, heavier)

- A shorter USB A &lt;> USB-C cable does double duty -- USB A to bring the charge to the phone / device via USB-C, then remove & flip USB-C into the input of the Anker, while plugging the 'A' end into any compatible port to recharge it.

- Comes with a black cloth bag with drawstring closure, which is nice to keep that short USB cable together with the device.  Nothing fancy, but useful.

- And probably the best, after using Qi-Wireless for 90% of the time over the life of the G8 -- this thing puts juice into the phone, quickly.  I can go from 5-15% charge to 30% in under 30min.  Not sure how many amps it's charging at (rated at 'up to 12' -?), but it's definitely quick.  If you're caught somewhere without power (or even if you're not) -- this device is a lifesaver (figuratively & perhaps literally, I guess).

Technically, I guess you're not supposed to use the phone while charging with a power bank, but it comes in handy for those times where you need to use the phone a little longer, but need a little juice to tide you over (it juices the phone so fast--especially vs. Qi-wireless--that you say ""I might as well just keep it hooked up to this)).  I think it'll charge close to 100% in about 90 minutes, maybe less.

- Since my G8 battery is ~ 3800 mAh (?), I can get up to two full charges out of this thing, or many 'partial' charges.  From full, 30 minutes' time on the G8 doesn't even remove one 'dot' from the 4-light meter.  This is real value, in my book.  Because most of the time, I can get back to a power source in 30min or so.

So... for what I'm using it for, which is to buy time until I decide to finally (!) upgrade my phone, and keep the S8 running a little while longer... it's an excellent accessory, from a trusted company.  Since this has been out a while, and been superseded by higher-cap devices, solar-capable chargers, etc. -- it's also cheap -- about the cost of one of those replacement battery kits (with batteries that came from who knows where).

Not often I unequivocally give the full 5-stars... but this product gets them from me.  Recommended.

146,R3C1HTWQPREMJL,Essential Power Solution for All Your Devices! 🔋📱,"Finding a reliable and efficient portable charger led me to the Anker Portable Charger, a power bank with a 10,000 mAh capacity and PowerIQ charging technology. With its compact design and USB-C (Input Only), it promised to be the perfect companion for my various devices, including the latest iPhones and Samsung Galaxy phones. After using it for several weeks, I can confidently say that this charger exceeds all expectations and has become an indispensable part of my tech setup.
Pros:

⚡ Powerful Performance: The 10,000 mAh battery pack provides ample power to keep my devices charged throughout the day. Whether it's my iPhone 15 Pro Max or Samsung Galaxy, this power bank delivers consistent and reliable performance, ensuring I'm never left with a dead battery.

🔋 PowerIQ Charging Technology: Anker's PowerIQ technology intelligently identifies connected devices to deliver the fastest possible charge. This feature is a game-changer, significantly reducing charging times and maximizing efficiency. My devices charge quickly and efficiently, making it perfect for those on the go.

💼 Compact and Portable: The sleek and compact design makes this power bank incredibly easy to carry. It fits perfectly in my bag or pocket, making it a convenient power solution for travel, work, or daily commutes. Despite its powerful capacity, it remains lightweight and portable.

🔌 Universal Compatibility: This charger is compatible with a wide range of devices, from the latest iPhone 15 series to various Samsung Galaxy models. This versatility ensures that I can use it with all my gadgets without any issues.

💡 High-Quality Build: Anker is known for its high-quality products, and this portable charger is no exception. The build quality is excellent, with a durable and sturdy design that gives me confidence in its longevity. The USB-C input ensures that recharging the power bank itself is quick and straightforward.
Cons:

🔄 USB-C Input Only: While the USB-C input is great for quickly recharging the power bank, it would have been even better if it also supported output through USB-C. This minor limitation doesn't detract much from its overall utility, but it would add an extra layer of convenience.

Reflecting on my experience with the Anker Portable Charger, it's clear that its powerful performance, compact design, and intelligent charging technology make it a top-notch choice for anyone in need of a reliable power bank.

This Anker PowerBank was Introduced on Amazon in 2019. I consider this a Basic Power Bank, the standout features are that it functions as expected based on its designed and engineered capabilities.
One would and should expect expert performance in both design, fit and function as well as performance with the use of quality parts from Anker. I consider this capacity of PowerBank to be a Hearty Workhorse in my or any stable of devices requiring power.
Performance must be assured, trusted.

- I can not rate battery life as I have placed it into use thus far in a limited way with bluetooth speakers, External USB A light &c.
- C and Micro USB inputs are fairly standard issue for this range (10,000 mAh) of PowerBank, as are the USB A output to charge or power your device using your supplied correct cable.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32YYJP9RK8OI2,Publius Publico,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/4d1314df-d47b-4ee9-8824-e20a2bfcfb8b._CR0,29.0,275,275_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2024",True,B07QXV6N1B,,,,

Not a huge deal as it's just a cosmetic issue, but they didn't come off even when wiping with isopropyl alcohol. Still not sure what they are a year later.

At any rate, it worked beautifully for the trip I needed it for and once or twice on the odd road trip since, but in the past month or so I've noticed it starting to swell very slightly. It isn't enough that it's very noticeable, but to the touch there is a slight puff. Given it's just over a year, I find that worrying.

Will be looking for a battery pack that charges over USB-C next time, since this one only charges over micro USB and it's one of the few devices left that I own that does.

154,RDZ0JT5O6K1QB,"Perfect & Easy to apply, even if your not very steady","I've been meaning to get a screen protector for my Galaxy 5 Watch that I received for Christmas & any time I looked in stores, they were out. So, I finally checked Amazon & came across these.
  I love that they have different colors & an easy to apply screen protector. But I especially love the Bumpers!! I never realized there was such a thing & any time I cross my arms, I end up hitting the buttons on my watch & changing things without meaning to & after a while it gets super annoying!
  So, while I just needed a screen protector, I also found I needed a bumper too! No more changed screens or even watch faces without meaning to, because now the buttons can't easily be pushed, especially by accident.
  In the photo I have the Clear bumper on & love it, but also love that there is a couple different pink too, because that is the color watch I wanted, but it's also nice to have black & silver if I ever want to change it up or match something I'm wearing a little better because pink doesn't always match my outfits.... And it's easy enough to change out!
  I do have 2 teeny air bubbles that keep reappearing, but it was my first time installing a screen protector, so if or when I need to change it out, hopefully I'll get a little better at it & not have that happen or maybe after awhile of doing the  squeegie move, lol, they will cease to return! Either way, they are super tiny so I'm not too worried about it and if they get bigger I can always change it out (I do have 4 more!) or even have my phone guy install it because he has far more practice and is way better at it than I.

157,R19OWH38GTDL03,A Screen and Overall Watch Protector of Such High Quality That It Looks Like it Was Made by Samsung,"I am currently sporting the Samsung Watch6 40mm, which is a beautiful daily companion, and I am very accident prone, so I knew I had to choose a very high quality and robust screen protect and bezel protector in order to perfectly preserve this watch's beauty for many years to come. I came across this KIMILAR 5 pack, which had bezel protectors in 5 different colors, along with 5 screen protectors, and this appealed to me greatly because I wanted a black colored bezel protector to match my watch and I really liked having the comfort of having 5 screen protectors because that meant I had 5 chances to install it correctly and perfectly (as I am also not the best screen protector installer).  I have been using the screen protector and bezel protector for over a month now and I can say with certainty that this is the best possible protector you can get for your Samsung watch, if you are searching through other similar products right now, please close your other tabs, because this is the best protector you can buy on Amazon, hands down, no doubts or questions about it. You can save yourself time and add this fantastic package to your cart right now and know that you are getting a quality product that will not let you down or disappoint you, but if you want to know more details about why this combo product is absolutely amazing, please read on!

I will tell you honestly that installing the screen protector itself was very easy and straightforward. What was not easy was ensuring that I did not get any dust trapped between the watch screen and the screen protector, this happened on my first try and was completely my fault. Which is why I was so happy that I had 4 more chances to get this right!! Thankfully on my second attempt, I was able to successfully center the screen protector and it adhered to the watch face quickly and perfectly. The screen protector does not impede the sensitivity or usability of the screen at all, it does not negatively impact the clarity of the screen itself (it still looks crystal clear), and the screen protector is very easy to clean when it gathers fingerprints and water droplets. The screen protector is of phenomenal quality, as I have exposed it from everything to rain and fingerprints to heavy hits against tabletops, and this screen protector has held up like a champion, and more importantly it has flawlessly protected my watch face with no signs of damage whatsoever.

Soon after I placed the screen protector upon my watch, I installed the black bezel protector and this device installed seamlessly on the Watch6 40mm, it fits snug like a glove, and as you can see in my pictures, the quality, color, and fitting of this bezel protector is so top notch that it looks like an OEM product that came preinstalled on the watch!! This bezel protector has been a boon for me as it has successfully protected my watch faithfully over the past month without any scratches, chips, or dents to the watch itself or the bezel protector through quite a few accidental wall thuds and table bumps.

Overall, I cannot praise this combo product offered by KIMILAR enough, it has protected my watch flawlessly and I know that it will continue to do so for many years to come. So, if you are looking for a quality protector for your new Samsung Watch, look no further, you have found it right here.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19OWH38GTDL03,Cory C.,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71OXAk-6ohL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71x-hA4YNLL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81bK1WT1MwL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81w6vSt7+6L._SY88.jpg']",,"Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2023",True,B0CBX6HNXR,23 people found this helpful,,,

This is my second purchase of a set of these protectors. I have several different color watchbands and wanted some variety in the screen protector colors as well so purchased this set which has different colors than the first set I ordered. So more were ordered to give me more color options.

I'm not always the most graceful person and have been known, in the course of doing normal every day things, to accidently smack my arm/hand/wrist against doorways, walls or whatnot. So having something to protect my watch face is a necessity for me.  A few months ago I was doing some yardwork and ended up with a hard knock up against a wooden shelf out in our garden shed as I was trying to keep some flowerpots from falling over the edge. It was a hard enough smack that I initially thought I may have broken my watch.

No one was more surprised than I when I looked down to check the watch and it was fine and working as usual. The protector that had been on it DID crack and actually fall off. But before its demise it did its job and valiantly protected the watch face from the impact. In essence, it gave its life to protect its ""client.""  Can't ask for more than that.

Both scenarios happened to me. A month after I purchased these (3-pack), the first cord bit the dust. The lightning end came unsheathed, exposing frayed wires. I tossed it and moved on to number two.

193,R22R4TQIAAKEL1,Incredible User Experience,"I typically don't write reviews for products, but WOW this one just really blew me away!

I bought this product at the end of 2019 when I bought my iPhone 11. As many others have said, the frame that comes with the screen protectors makes installing the protectors an absolute breeze. However, the thing that really stuck out to me was the attention to detail this company made with making sure the entire user experience was as smooth as possible. After using my phone for a little bit longer than a year, I finally managed to drop it so that the screen protector cracked. It did its job, not leaving so much as even a dent on the actual screen underneath. Then I got the kit from out of storage and prepared to replace the screen, and that's when I realized how much I appreciated the product. So much so that I had to write a review about it after a year since I bought it.

A few things to note about the replacement process that I just love:
-The instructions are in proper English with visual diagrams to walk you through the process. With so many Chinese products out on the market today, it is such a relief to read instructions without having to sift through countless grammatical errors.
-The kit not only includes a screen protector and guiding frame, it also has wet wipes, dry wipes, even a dust absorber sticker in order to make sure that your screen can be completely clean before you stick the screen protector on it, what fantastic additions
-There are three sets of everything! Wet wipes, dry wipes, dust absorber stickers, screen protectors, the kit is equipped so that you can have three solid and individually completed screen protector installations

For its price point, this kit just can't be beat. I would absolutely recommend this product, and will certainly buy again in the future when the need arises.

I dropped my phone recently face down onto a concrete pad from a height of around three feet.  When I picked it up I felt sick: the phone face was covered with spider-web-like cracks.  I peeled off the protector to find that the screen on my phone was completely unharmed.  The screen protector absorbed all the damage.

******************

I spent a little more for this brand of screen protector and am glad I did.  I've found in the past that, despite reading directions and following them carefully, sometimes when I install these something goes awry and I end up throwing one or two of the protector screens away.

There's little chance of that happening with these.  The protector shields come with a template frame that the phone snaps into; you place the top of the protector screen carefully between the edges of this frame and then the entire film fits into place easily.  Unsnap the frame from around the phone and you're good to go.  It's fairly foolproof (and I can be a fool doing this.)  It took me less than three minutes to install this, from opening the box, reading the instructions, cleaning and drying the phone screen thoroughly, and applying the protector.

I've never found a protector so easy to install.  No air bubble troubles at all.  It protects the screen well, with no glare problems, and leaves a small space (~1/8"" or ~ 3 mm) between the edge of the protector and edge of the phone.  I use an Otterbox case to protect the phone.  It fit easily back into that afterward.

I'll buy this brand again without hesitation.  It's worth spending a bit more virtually to eliminate the chance that I'll waste one or two of the protector screens via installing them incorrectly.  I'm a very satisfied customer.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2TPG4ZHF7KJPS,Bill,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on May 30, 2020",True,B07FR1LQNZ,4 people found this helpful,,,

beyond what I would have expected, it doesn't change the facts of my initial experience.

However, I have not had any issues with the screen protector after I got a good one and got it on, which by the way is very easy with the included alignment tool. It fits well, easy to keep clean, the device is still very responsive with SP on. I have not had any issues with scratching, and I do carry the device in my pocket.

I will say, don't dismiss this product because of my initial review (and a 2-star rating, which I will change). I do believe it's a fine product with a great tool to assist with installation, and the company's initiative to have a good product and satisfy the customer is exceptional in today's business world.

200,R3U0R2P0DR4M83,Very easy to install,"I’ve always gone to a Verizon store to have my screen protector installed because I don’t want to mess it up doing it myself and I have a little OCD where even a small bubble will irritate the hell out of me.

This time though I got tired of paying $$$ to have this done “professionally”,  so I figured whatever I’ll give Amazon a try. I read a lot of reviews of a lot of products and found that this XDesign had the best potential out of all other products I looked at so I bought it. It was mailed to me pretty fast, however, when I received the item, I chickened out and let it sit on the kitchen counter for over a month because I thought I wasn’t ready to be disappointed lol. My old screen protector was fine, just had a slight crack across the screen so I thought I’d live with it a little longer.

Today I decided that it’s the day to stop being a coward and install the new screen protector I got from XDesign. I looked up installation videos on YouTube which I found out later was useless because the manual guide that came in the box was literally all I needed!!

The whole installation process took me less than 2 minutes and it came out PERFECT without any bubbles—I was ecstatic! The frame helps a lot to make sure that the screen protector is installed properly and not off to one side where you might have that ‘rainbow effect’ problem. Once you have the screen protector aligned and pressed down, the whole screen just starts adhering to the phone screen all by itself and all you need to do it smooth out the corners and, voila it’s done! When my husband comes home, I’m going to change his old screen protector and install this one lol!

222,R1SOA04H24RPUK,Sonic the Hedgehog - A Blast of Nostalgia and Adventure,"As a child of the '90s, I grew up with the iconic video game character Sonic the Hedgehog. So, when I heard that a live-action movie was being made, my inner child couldn't help but jump with excitement. I walked into the theater with a mix of anticipation and a touch of nostalgia, hoping that the film would capture the essence of the beloved blue speedster. And let me tell you, Sonic the Hedgehog did not disappoint.

From the moment the movie started, I was transported back to my childhood, the world of Sega Genesis, and countless hours spent guiding Sonic through vibrant, fast-paced levels. The film beautifully blends the animated world with live-action, seamlessly bringing Sonic and his iconic friends to life. Sonic himself is an absolute delight. His energy, wit, and mischievous personality are perfectly captured, and I found myself cheering for him as he raced across the screen.

What impressed me the most was the attention to detail and the respect for the source material. The film cleverly weaves in references and Easter eggs for the die-hard Sonic fans, like myself. From the iconic golden rings to the sound effects of collecting rings and even the way Sonic curls into a ball during his signature spin attack, every element was meticulously crafted to make fans feel right at home. I couldn't help but smile every time I caught one of these nostalgic nods.

But Sonic the Hedgehog isn't just about nostalgia; it also delivers an engaging and heartwarming story. The film centers around Sonic's journey to protect his newfound friends and find a sense of belonging in a world that is new and strange to him. The character development is surprisingly deep, and I found myself emotionally invested in Sonic's quest to find his place in the world. The dynamic between Sonic and the bumbling but endearing Tom, played by James Marsden, adds an extra layer of humor and heart to the story.

Jim Carrey's portrayal of the iconic villain, Dr. Robotnik, is an absolute scene-stealer. Carrey's over-the-top energy and comedic timing bring the character to life in the most delightful and hilarious way possible. He perfectly captures the essence of the mad scientist, making him a formidable yet entertaining adversary for Sonic.

Sonic the Hedgehog is a rollercoaster ride of action, adventure, and heartfelt moments that will resonate with both fans of the video game franchise and newcomers alike. It captures the spirit and charm of Sonic in a way that is relatable and accessible, making it a fun experience for audiences of all ages. This movie reminded me why I fell in love with Sonic as a kid and reignited my passion for this beloved character.

So, whether you're a die-hard Sonic fan or just looking for an entertaining and nostalgic ride, I wholeheartedly recommend Sonic the Hedgehog. Grab some popcorn, fasten your seatbelt, and get ready to speed through a world of adventure with the fastest hedgehog around.

224,R3QLYX0E0X66VU,"Finally, they've got it right.","Look I know it goes without saying since its long become a trope with Hollywood failing to bring a video game property to the silver screen. Gaming has been around for decades and has become such a huge facet of the entertainment industries that you would think somebody would have hit long before. The Resident Evil series has been the closest they've ever come before in an adaptation and even then there were liberties taken with the source material as is done in most cases when the corporate machine gets their hands in on it, but for some reason Sonic was able to run past all of this kind of meddling and into theaters in a way that does so much justice to gaming in just this one movie.

For starters they listened to the backlash. When the first Sonic model was revealed it was a horrid mess, and a reworking fashioned the character much more like the game and imaginations of gamers everywhere could imagine him. Some would argue pandering to fans a bad thing but at the end of the day when it comes to movies with gaming as its core source to alienate them is to risk having your work fail at the box office and ruin your chances of any kind of profit. The end result is a much better looking character model and fan support.

The story isn't an all-too original one, either. Alien from outside earth comes to planet seeking to be accepted, and man seeking an elusive ideal doesn't realize he had it all along to begin with. But the combination of both plot lines and addition of gaming elements (the rings, Robotnik, and the cameo of Tails at the end) creates somehow a fresh look at both. There is just enough callbacks and easter eggs referencing the Sonic game series to be nostalgia tasting without overdoing it to the point of annoyance. Heck, even the recurring joke about Olive Garden serves not just as a product placement but an easter eggs itself ""When You're Here, You're Family,"" which I take as being about the movie's meaning.

Funny how a game series that at least for most of its titles were sidescrolling platform games with barely a whiff of plot (as most platformers were back in those days) was able to capture audiences through a movie experience (and sequel, too) where so many plot-driven titles have failed in the past. It seemed a real passion for the source material could be felt which must have resonated by many of those who worked on it. Even Jim Carrey--the perfect actor for Robotnik--was motivated to star in this because of his daughter's love of the games in her youth.

Great movie, fun, engaging, familiar, and heartwarming and campy--just what movies need to be sometimes without much exposition and elements of messaging which seem to hard to find these days. Great for kids and adults.

Bonus (and spoilers):  On my recent watch It dawned on me that in the final battle with Robotnik in Green Hill Sonic had to bounce against the chassis of Eggman's ship multiple times before it finally went down, which to me was done specifically to echo the repeated hits you needed to make on boss battles in the game. Another example of the filmmakers effort to try to bring elements from the source to the screen and did so awesomely.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QLYX0E0X66VU,Joshua A.

225,R2337AQWJF7CX5,"The best video game movie, but it's not quite high praise.","As many of you recall, Paramount released their first trailer for the new Sonic film early last year. Many of its fans were freaked out by the redesign of the title character, especially in regard to the smaller eyes and human teeth. The backlash was not entirely unexpected; Paramount had figured that fans would have objections, but that the general public wouldn’t mind (as was the case with the Michael Bay TMNT films). The idea was that this new design would blend in better with the real-world atmosphere than a more cartoony look.

However, the redesign caught the attention of the media, and at this point, Paramount made an usual decision: they were going to delay the release by several months, just to redesign Sonic. This was especially unusual as the general thought was that the film was going to suck anyway, and wasn’t worth the effort. After I saw the trailer, I thought that it was a fool's errand, noting that it seemed to be a waste of money for what looked like a generic kids film.

My History With Sonic

Growing up, I never really got into the Sonic The Hedgehog games. Ours was a Nintendo household, so my only exposure was playing Sega games at a friend’s house. When I played the games years later via emulator, I didn’t really enjoy them. They seemed to offer style over substance with little challenge, whereas Mario games had actual difficulty and innovation.

Where Sonic had the edge was in television. The various Super Mario animated shows were all terrible, filled with lame pop culture references (“May the pasta be with you!”)and your usual children’s show cliches. Conversely, the two Sonic shows seems to have a much better plot, in particular the Saturday Morning show (“He’s the fastest thing ALIVE!”).

I was never planning to see this in theaters, as video game movies are almost invariably awful. The film looked like a trainwreck with or without the redesign, and it was aimed at kids anyway. However, sitting bored at home one quarantined afternoon, I decided on a whim to see what the rental price was on Prime Video. Turned out it was free for me; I had a $5.99 Prime Video credit due to some late deliveries, so I figured I’d check it out.

The Film

The movie starts in medias res with Sonic being chased through a city by Dr. Robotnik, before pausing on a freeze-frame. Yep, we’re doing the ‘How we got here” cliche.

It then flashes back to several years prior, where Sonic grows up on some unnamed planet that matches the Green Hill Zone from the games. Sonic is raised by some owl who is described as being like Obi-Wan Kenobi. However, we never have time to see why, as the film rushes through this opening. Yep, this was just shot for the trailers. Sonic and the owl are attached by the Echidna tribe, and the owl saves Sonic by tossing him in a ring portal, warping him to Earth.

Sonic grows up in the wilderness of Green Hills, Montana, a quiet little town. He was warned to lay low, but uses his super speed to survive, living off-the-grid in a secret cave. He secretly observes the lives of Tom and Maddie Wachowski, the local sheriff and veterinarian, wanting to be their friend. In frustration at being alone, Sonic’s super speed causes an EMP. This gains the attention of the Pentagon and their scientific advisor, Dr. Robotnik.
Tom finds Sonic hiding in his shed, and after some misunderstandings agrees to help Sonic get to San Francisco to retrieve his rings. And the rest of the film is a road trip adventure to achieve that goal. Will Sonic make it, and will he and Tom learn the power of true friendship™?

Like I mentioned, this film really wasn’t aimed at me. If it had come out in the 90’s, I would have certainly seen this, though perhaps the CGI wouldn’t have been possible at the time. The film certainly isn’t a trainwreck, but it is your cliched kids movie. Most of the adult actors are clearly phoning it in, and the theme of wanting to make friends is a little too juvenile for this film.

The plot is rather thin, and considering that the film clocks in at a brisk 90 minutes, one gets the impression that some of the backstory was edited out. Tom wants to leave Green Hills to become a San Francisco cop, yet at the end of the film decides not to, with little explanation. Dr. Robotnik is also unexplored. You get the idea that he became a misanthrope after being bullied as a kid, but most bullying victims don’t become supervillains.
Having said that, Ben Schwartz is great as Sonic, employing the cockiness and devil-may-care attitude of the games. I was expecting to hate Jim Carrey in this film, but he pulled off enough funny scenes and lines to remind us of his 90’s self.

The film does have some cool super-speed moments. Sure, they do rip off the Quicksilver scenes from the X-Men films, but it’s cool to see all the details here. And when a smirking Sonic is tapping his foot on the Transamerica Pyramid while surrounded by missiles, I thought “Yeah, that’s Sonic.”

As expected with kids films, there is some obnoxious product placement. There are at least two references to Olive Garden, and one to Zillow. They’re certainly not as blatant as the Krispy Kreme plugs in the recent Power Rangers film, but they stand out like a sore thumb.

The film is the exception that proves the rule of “Video Game Movies suck.” . It spends far too much time on Earth and the usual kids film cliches, while I believe that it could have done so much more. Why were the Echidnas after Sonic? How does he have his powers? What made Robotnik this way? Sure, we get to see Tails at the end. but it’s that really cheap trick of saving everything for the sequel. If you’re going to make a Sonic film, go all-out and make it a passion project, not a potboiler.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2337AQWJF7CX5,Erik T,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on August 11, 2020",True,B0D8HMMSS6,2 people found this helpful,,,

In my case, everything I need music-wise happens to be on my cell phone.  With nowhere to place my cellphone on these digital pianos without it sliding off (just by playing the instrument), using this double-sided suction cup holder has done the trick!

239,R1LTTIX9PY63P7,Amazing Quality Headphones- you won't regret purchasing these!,"I purchased my first pair of Golrex headphones over a year ago, and have been extremely impressed with the sound quality and durability of these earbuds. I am extremely hard on equipment: I've exposed these earbuds to water and dropped the case multiple times and found that they are extremely durable and will work well in either extreme heat or cold (I'm a Minnesota girl). They still work beautifully and pair almost instantly after 1+ years of everyday use. I like that they included a charging case & cord, both have held up well and are obviously well-made for longer-term use.

I like the design of these earbuds tremendously- they sit very comfortably in the ear and the earbud itself is very sleek and sporty. The instruction manual provided is very straightforward and provides a diagram on how to correctly position the earbud within the ear which I found very helpful. The instruction manual also includes maintenance tips, and what the indicator status in the earbud indicates, i.e.

Power on: White light for 1s; Power-off: Red light for 1s; Pairing mode of the earphones: White light of dual earbuds flash; etc...

The battery life lasts around 2 weeks for me, which is very nice as I can leave them in my gym bag without having to take them out and charge them every night. Pairing and setup are so simple, and I am very happy with how well these have held up with consistent, longer-term use. Cleaning these earbuds is simple as the rubber ear tips are easy to pop off the top. I've also noticed that they don't tend to collect as much wax/debris as some of my other earbuds which is nice.

When I received my earbuds, a QR code was attached to the top of the charging case (see the first image) that gave instructions on how to register the Earbuds with Golrex for a lifetime warranty. This warranty not only includes defects but also damaged or lost products. The icing on the cake here is that you do not have to return the defective items, which as a busy student I appreciate tremendously.

I use the Golrex headphones for lifting, running, and around the house for everyday things. They stay in the ear very well-- I've taken them on 10+ mile runs with zero issues. After 15 minutes or so of wearing them I forget I have them in. I was initially cautious to purchase these, as I figured the quality must be lower due to the lower price but I could not have been more wrong. They have held up better than my Sony & Jlab earbuds which I purchased at a higher price point.

Overall, the GOLREX 100H Playtime was a solid purchase for me, and checked all of my boxes. I needed an earbud that was affordable, durable, with excellent sound quality and noise cancellation that would hold a charge for a long length of time. These earbuds deliver that and more, and I'm very grateful that I gave them a chance. I would highly recommend this product.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1LTTIX9PY63P7,Hannah,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61JxMJwtFqL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Xlb3Y52EL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61ZhaZZat4L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hhkGKg7lL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71sdM3LoA3L._SY88.jpg']",,"Reviewed in the United States on May 22, 2024",True,B0D676BXDV,42 people found this helpful,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/vse-vms-transcoding-artifact-us-east-1-prod/911526f4-0001-4c48-9c54-1b05b3bf630f/default.vertical.jobtemplate.hls.m3u8,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/vse-vms-closed-captions-artifact-us-east-1-prod/closedCaptions/16982b73-8a7c-4394-b9ae-ef45adb9f0b1.vtt,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61IskRZNWIL._SY256._SY256.jpg

241,R3733TW9HTX3V6,Fantastic Bluetooth Headphones!,"Let me start by saying I've been through my fair share of headphones. From bulky wired sets to the trendy true wireless kind, I've experienced the good, the bad, and the constantly-falling-out. But these Bluetooth headphones? They're a game-changer.
Effortless Pairing and Use: A Tech Novice's Dream
Setting up these headphones was a breeze. Gone are the days of wrestling with menus and cryptic instructions. Pairing them with my phone was as simple as flipping a switch – seriously! The connection is rock-solid too, no annoying drop-outs or stuttering playback. Even better, using them is intuitive. A few taps on the controls handle everything – volume, playback, calls – all without ever fumbling for my phone.
Stay-Put Security: No More Earbud Escapades
Here's the real win for me: these headphones stay put. The over-ear design hugs my ears comfortably without feeling too tight, and the secure fit eliminates the constant worry of them tumbling out during a workout or jog. This has been a revelation! No more scrambling to catch an earbud bouncing down the sidewalk, and no more feeling self-conscious about them slipping out mid-conversation.
All-Day Battery Life: Powering Through Without a Recharge
Speaking of workouts, the battery life on these headphones is phenomenal. I've been using them for a couple of weeks now, and I haven't even come close to hitting the bottom. The headphones themselves last a good 6+ hours on a single charge, which is more than enough for even the most extended listening sessions. But the real kicker is the charging case. I've gotten at least 6 full recharges for the headphones out of it so far, and it feels like it could keep going – all without needing to scramble for a power outlet.
Crystal Clear Audio: A Symphony for Your Ears
Now, let's talk about the sound quality. These headphones deliver rich, immersive audio that rivals even the high-end brands. The bass is deep and satisfying without being overwhelming, and the mids and highs are crisp and clear. Whether you're rocking out to your favorite tunes, taking a call, or using them as a discreet hearing aid in noisy environments (guilty as charged!), the sound quality is top-notch.
Simple Care: A Low-Maintenance Must-Have
These headphones are as easy to maintain as they are to use. A quick wipe with a soft cloth keeps them looking sharp, and the lack of any complicated crevices means no gunk build-up to worry about.
The Verdict: A Sound Investment (Without Breaking the Bank!)
Look, I can't tell you exactly how long these headphones will last on a single charge – because frankly, I haven't been able to use them long enough to find out. But here's what I can tell you: they deliver superior sound quality, exceptional comfort, and a secure fit that eliminates the earbud-juggling act. The long-lasting battery life, both in the headphones and the case, is a huge bonus, and the effortless pairing and use make them a techie's dream.
So, if you're looking for a pair of Bluetooth headphones that tick all the boxes – amazing sound, secure fit, hassle-free use, and long battery life – then look no further. These headphones are, without a doubt, worth every penny. They might not have the flashy brand name, but in terms of performance and value, they leave the competition in the dust.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3733TW9HTX3V6,Gary Sailer,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51+7Tzsbc8L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51AB0svKYEL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612-bGAOD0L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hWJynFfgL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61w+05hyuGL._SY88.jpg']",,"Reviewed in the United States on May 21, 2024",True,B0D676BXDV,34 people found this helpful,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/vse-vms-transcoding-artifact-us-east-1-prod/a5743980-51f4-4c1e-8bb4-7f6d489344a0/default.vertical.jobtemplate.hls.m3u8,,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51854USb0uL._SY256._SY256.jpg
242,R2Y7QQDK0EVFZ,A great pair of earbuds,"My friend turned me on to this company so I bought this pair of Golrex T59 earbuds to try out for myself. I always like to try things out for several weeks before leaving a review so I can really test them out. I am happy to report that these headphones have passed the test! Pairing was easy and the instructions were helpful especially with the wearing of the earbuds.  My usual go to headphones don't have the piece that goes over your ear so the diagram that shows how to position the earbuds within the ear was very helpful. The instruction manual also explains what the different colored lights mean and what function happens when pushing the button on either earbud. The earbud itself is comfortable to wear and the ear hook design really helps keep it in place.

I really like that the charging case itself that houses the earbuds can be charged either with the included cord or with a wireless charger. When my case runs low I just have to set it on my wireless charger and walk away with no cord to mess with. When the case is charging you will see a white light that flashes slowly letting you know that it is being charged. The light will stay solid to let you know when the case is fully charged. You also get 3 different sized rubber tips for a more customized fit in your ear.

I deliver mail and always have one  earbud  in during my delivery day. I am either listening to music, a podcast, or talking on the phone with other carriers. These earbuds sound great on both ends! My friends have commented about how much more clearly they can hear me when we are talking. That says a lot because there is a lot of background noise between my mail truck, the fan in my mail truck, and general outside noise. I can also hear them clearly on my end. I am kind of a basshead when it comes to music and these earbuds do not disappoint. I have turned the volume up as loud as I can stand it and the sound is still clear with no distortion at all. I can use an earbud for about 6.5 hrs on average before I get the low battery warning. Then I just switch sides and continue on with my day.

The Golrex T59 earbuds have turned out to be a great purchase. The fit, sound quality, battery life, and lightweight design make it a great value and I am very grateful that my friend turned me on to them.

243,RX9380BYVP64N,Excellent Wireless Earbuds,"The Golrex T59 shows you don’t have to spend hundreds of dollars to get top quality sound from wireless earbuds.  This is a high quality product that is backed by a lifetime warranty - that alone shows how the company feels about the product, and I have used their products in the past and can assure you they stand by their lifetime warranty, no questions ask and no need to return the product back to them.  It arrived in very nice packaging, with a highly sturdy/durable charging case, several sized earbuds (S, M, L), a usb charging cable, and a well written instruction manual.  The things I like most about these earbuds are number one, the sound they produce - as high a sound quality of earbuds that cost hundreds more.  The second thing I am very impressed with is the battery life of this model - it is very long lasting.  Once fully charged, the power will last for multiple hours long sessions at the gym (which is what I used them for), not to mention the comfort fit to your ear.  Again, I use them while working out which is why the design is so nice.  The over-the-ear clip secures the earbud and ensures they do not fall out during high impact activity.  Finally, these earbuds easily pair up with any Bluetooth devices and have excellent range without sound degradation.

I utilize different pairs for workout, travel and at home.  I figure sometimes you loose them so why not have an extra pair.

This new pair reflects some improved tech, the sound quality is excellent and bluetooth is seamless.  While all my headphones have shown exceptional battery life, this new one is even be better.  Much like the other pairs, it’s really comfortable wear for several hours whether being active or just hanging out.

245,R1VCUV2TPSA7S0,Really excellent wireless Bluetooth headphones,"These are now the fourth pair of these earbuds I have bought. I absolutely love these earbuds. For the money you really can’t beat these. I originally wanted a pair of self charging earbuds that hooked over the ears because my ears tend to be sensitive and hard ones that just shove in my ear I can’t stand to wear for very long.  I can wear these for hours on end with no discomfort. The set comes with different size ear canal sleeves so pretty easy to find comfortable fit.  I’m a musician so I’m pretty particular about sound quality. While I can’t say these are the best in terms of audio quality, they really are very good considering the price point and the features you get. The bass is pretty punching and thick and highs are pretty clear. I’d love a little more in the mids as the mids tend to get a little overwhelmed in the mix with these earbuds but it ok and maybe a little more overall volume but that’s me being really nitpicky. I walk regularly five to six times a week both on a treadmill in my garage and outdoors around my community and occasionally I do some running and these have stayed put in/on my ears no matter what I’ve thrown at them.  I sweat pretty good and that has never caused any issues with any of the sets I have own.  These earbuds are fairly good at sound isolating.  I feel pretty closed off from the world when I’m listening to music or talking on a phone conversation.  I’ve even used these from time to time for a zoom conference call and they’ve performed very well.
Self charging in the case and the case itself can plug in or wireless charge.  I really love that these have a screen that shows how much charge is left in the case so I know I always have a way to keep my earbuds fully charged.  It’s also really nice that there are separate indicators for both right and left that show each individual earbud is charging.  They also handle phone calls really well. The built in microphones pick up really well and I have never had anyone complain about audio quality on a phone when I’m using them to talk on the phone. I haven’t had any issues or glitches with any of the sets I have bought. Battery life is a couple hours out of the ear buds themselves, I’ve never managed to drain the case fully before recharging it but I’ve gotten at least 4 earbud recharges out of the case.  I have two complaints with these. The function for adjusting volume with the earbuds isn’t the most intuitive and I usually forget the button sequence to do that so I usually end up adjusting on my device instead of on the earbuds.  My only other complaint is color choice. I really wish I could a set of these in red.  Hopefully someday this will be an option. I really love these earbuds and they tend to go everywhere with me.  I definitely recommend them.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VCUV2TPSA7S0,Trey Kinsey,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/617ee92wJAL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61YRKXHEkUL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61rWOw4ctBL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71AmaL-ZNHL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71bNab-7SFL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71dBqSEewsL._SY88.jpg']",,"Reviewed in the United States on May 18, 2024",True,B0D676BXDV,33 people found this helpful,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/vse-vms-transcoding-artifact-us-east-1-prod/9df8e3df-0ffc-459f-8b88-443a3afbfc30/embedded.cc.default.vertical.jobtemplate.hls.m3u8,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/S/vse-vms-closed-captions-artifact-us-east-1-prod/closedCaptions/bf27cb33-94a2-4010-999a-d66ac0e434b7.vtt,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71t1RXudLeL._SY256._SY256.jpg

This is helpful as I'm often listening to music on the move. It's very nice when I'm exercising as I don't need to worry about my earbuds coming off. Second, these earbuds have great sound. I can hear the high notes and the low notes. It comes through crystal clear. Third, these earbuds have a very long charge. This is so helpful as I don't need to recharge them for a long period of time. And when they new to recharge, I can just throw them on my phone charging pad. The case acts as a charger. Not only do the earbuds have a long charge, but they can recharge in the case. I appreciate the charging gauge on the case. This provides quick access to see the level of charge that is present. Then I always know when a recharge may be warranted. The cost is incredible for the functionality and sound of these earbuds. They are just as good with extra added features compared to other expensive brands. I am not sure why someone would pay so much money for other earbuds that don't have all the fesutes that these have. Why pay more for something that is less? I've purchased from this company before. Fortunately, I have not had to use the warranty, but the company has been very responsive in the activation of the promised warranty. I am very happy with the purchase of the earbuds. The shipping time was super fast. It came with its own charging cable. It also has different sized comfortable ear buds to fit different ears. The earbuds also have touch control adjustments which are very convenient. So when I'm on the move I can answer phone calls or skip tracks without having to pull out my phone.

262,RPXWGS2PWXY7G,"Wow, these are great for the price","They really are really nice headsets for the price (29.99 at time of review). Connection is quick upon powering up. It has been working without a single drop. Battery life is very good, easily lasing multiple gaming sessions on a charge and to be more specific, I'm taking real 4-8 hour sessions. The sound quality is  pretty darn good with a decent balance of bass, mids and treble that doesn't have me looking for a way to EQ them. The mic comes through loud and clear.

This headset has been fantastic so far! It has excellent battery life and can last me a while week without charging and I’m glad it can be recharged with USB C.

The headset is comfortable to wear even for extended periods of time. I am glad that it has great compatibility with the PS5 and easily syncs up by just plugging the signal into the USB.

I also love the look! When you turn on the headset it has cool neon rainbow lights on the side which looks sweet!

Sound quality has been excellent! Also this is not a noise cancelling headset which in my opinion is much better. I have a wife and 2 kids and prefer to be able to hear if someone is trying to communicate with me without having to take the headset off.

The LED strips are really cool and crisp, they have very sharp color representation and decent brightness. Of course, that doesn't matter when they're on your head, but they look like cans that cost a whole bunch more, thus making you look cooler.

The NUBW) G05 is great! The set fits easily on my head and it takes a long time for the earpieces to become even slightly uncomfortable.

The machine didn't have Bluetooth so a USB Bluetooth adapter was added a few years ago.  After charging the headset I was able to get it to connect to via Bluetooth.  The problem was after using it for 30 seconds it would disconnect. I tried to trouble shoot it but nothing worked.  The problem could have been with the Bluetooth adapter and not the headset.  I then tried plugging in the USB adapter that came with the headset.  In a few seconds it was recognized by the operating system and then I turned on the headset and bingo all was working.  I've used it now for about 8 hours total, maybe 3 different sessions.  Everyone that I've been in contact with said they could hear and understand me with no problems. I was able to hear the game and all the player conversations.  The headset is comfortable to wear and does a decent job of blocking some sounds but it's not noise cancelling and that's fine for my use. I do like that it has a sound level knob/spinner rather than buttons.  I keep getting confused between the Mute and Power button but that's just because they're new.

It's not going to rival a $100+ pair of headphones, but you can definitely play games and listen to music and enjoy it, and the mic works well enough for streaming or voice chat.

270,RQ7B2F9RO94KE,Impressive for the price,"This gaming headset delivers excellent latency performance with the 2.4ghz USB dongle.
The connection with the USB dongle didn't need any pairing or setup, and the USB dongle was recognized as a sound device right away. The dongle lights up blue when plugged in, which is a nice touch to help you spot it.

The latency is very low in my non-scientific testing, comparable to Razer Blackshark V2 Pro and even faster than some USB wired DACs.

The sound quality is very good for the price but lackluster when you compare it against $200 headsets (I have Logitech G Pro X, Razer Blackshark V2 Pro, Sennheiser, etc. as reference). Still, the sound quality is the best I've seen in a sub $50 headphone category.

The headset is generally comfortable, with some extension and some minimal angle adjustment. There's no rotation on the earpieces. The headset looks good but it's mostly plastic.

The earcup is much better than expected, because I never saw a proper full-sized earcups in this price range. Usually the earcups are small like Bose headphones, but this one is comparable to Blackshark's earcups. These are pleather sealed earcups so the ears will get warm but other than that, these do a great job sealing the sound in.

The mic quality is adequate, but not exceptional. It's good enough for casual conversations or meetings but not high fidelity. To be fair, most wireless headsets also have poor mic quality.

Overall these are very very good for the price, but you'll find shortcomings when comparing to high end headsets.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQ7B2F9RO94KE,CameraMan,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on July 6, 2024",False,B0D812Z2T1,,,,

This headset is very lightweight, easy to clean, and has the obligatory RGB (which let's admit IS pretty cool). I had some trouble initially trying to use the bluetooth, but that's because Playstation is not very BT friendly. It does work great on the wireless end though. The sound is very clear when you're listening through them, although I do feel like it lacked some depth. When I gamed with my friends, they said the mic was clear, but that they could tell it wasn't the headset I normally use. I probably wouldn't use this as a dedicated mic while I'm streaming. To be fair, my regular headset is a pretty expensive one that I really love, it's just not comfortable for me all the time.

289,R1XPPRG5523PQ5,"Awesome! Rugged, huge storage capacity, fast charging and a light too!","I keep a power bank in the glove box of our SUV for those times when we need juice for our tech and are out and about. The one I had in there before stopped working after about 6 years (I would top off the recharge every three months, so it was always ready to go) but it was a low-end unit that did its job but now it was time for something better! I wanted a power bank that not only had a huge capacity, but was also rugged and could do some solar recharging as we mainly use the power bank at my son's travel baseball games or my daughter's twirling competitions. This way, we don't have to run back to the car for a quick charge when our cell phones and tablets would get low on power. Luckily, I found this very cool Power Bank by Hiluckey that does an excellent job at recharging our stuff! It's super rugged, so I don't have to worry if I drop it off the top of the bleachers or it gets stepped on by one of my kids when they are celebrating one of their great accomplishments and come running over to us!
The solar charging feature is a very nice add-on and makes it easy to keep the power bank charged as we use it up over the entire day. It holds an awesome 27,000 mAh of power which can charge up me and my wife's iPhones and our iPad's with no issues and we still have plenty of power to spare! So much power that several parents have asked to bum a quick charge from us. Maybe I should start charging them a fee! Lol! It has three outputs, a USB-C in/out port and two USB-A output ports, so it charge up to three devices simultaneously.

290,R1KU777QI6LUG2,Days of power,"Awesome solar charger / power bank, with stellar utility and a powerfully large 27000mAh capacity. When this is on a full charge, it can provide a week of power supply (6-8 phone charges, etc). It's got a good hefty feel in the hand using it, and weighs in at just over 1lb. The indicator lights aren’t the easiest to see clearly.

The ability to recharge itself without a plug and a socket is priceless, though not the quickest way to recharge (which depends on sun’s intensity, outdoor temperature, and weather conditions, but is nonetheless a fantastic back-up power source). For travel; packing two charging cables (type A and C), an adapter for versatility, and the included charging cable, is days of power without a second thought. The ports are snug fitting and work good.

The flashlight is surprisingly bright at night and it lit up a really large area (think whole camping area). Finding the power button in the dark on this thing will take a familiar feel I don’t have yet (it blends in without a distinguishing feature).

I did notice when charging in the sun that I needed items to prop up the panel to angle it for the best direct sunlight. I had the thought it needed a small antenna type rod built into the side to use as an adjustable stand… in the meantime, I forage for props. It would have been nice to come with a lanyard or carabiner of some sort, but I found one that works and will also clip onto my rucksack.

292,RMHKTCNP5R556,"Great charger, rugged, solar is a bit slow to charge","This charger has a TON of juice and charges my iPhone 15 Pro very quickly. Included cables are fine. The solar recharging is rather slow, it didn't indicate that it was charging unless I had it in fairly direct sunlight (indoor light wasn't enough), and it charged fairly slowly, but this is a big battery and the solar panel is not that large, so this is no surprise. I like the very rugged case, especially since I got this for camping & emergency situations. My biggest issue is that the power button to turn on the light is fairly exposed and there is no way to ""lock"" it, which means it's not inconceivable that this turns the light on while in a pack and drains the battery. I dinged a star for the power button and slow solar charging, but don't let either of these issues stop you from buying, they are just places where there is some room for improvement.

301,R2QET47R71JBJ0,Carino quanto inutile,"Ero proprio curioso di provarlo perché non ne avevo mai visto uno così piccolino; non mi aspettavo nulla per carità e infatti una volta acceso e riprodotti 3, 4 brani ho capito che era proprio quello che credevo: Un inutile spreco di soldi!

In confezione, oltre allo speaker troviamo un cavo USB-C per la ricarica e i classici manuali d’uso.

BR08 è un minuscolo speaker davvero ben realizzato mediante materiali di buona qualità, con molta cura per i dettagli; ad esempio è molto bella la presenza della stoffa a copertura dell’altoparlante che ingloba anche i tasti di volume e avanzamento al suo interno. Ho molto apprezzato la presenza della clip a molla posteriore che racchiude anche una clip a calamita per essere applicato su ogni indumento o superficie senza problemi. In alto c’è il connettore USB-C chiuso da un coperchio in gomma che evita l’ingresso di polvere o acqua al suo interno.

Si accende tramite l’unico tasto disponibile sulla scocca. Tasto che al suo interno racchiude un LED multifunzione che ci permette di capire se è acceso, se in fase di pairing e altre funzioni.

Collegarlo al vostro smartphone sarà semplicissimo, infatti una volta accesso sarà subito individuabile e accoppiabile al vostro terminale.

Se non fosse per la qualità audio questa cassa sarebbe perfetta, infatti tutto funziona alla perfezione all’infuori della riproduzione musicale. La cassa non ha un volume eccezionale e soprattutto oltre ad essere priva di bassi (me lo aspettavo ovviamente), ha alti impastati e gracchianti anche con un volume medio e non al massimo.

Può fungere anche da vivavoce, in questa modalità è molto comodo perché oltre a permetterci di parlare con l’interlocutore a mani libere si sente anche abbastanza bene e forte.

Non ho altro da aggiungere se non che al prezzo a cui è proposto lo trovo davvero uno spreco assurdo di denaro, non vale assolutamente la pena buttare quasi 40€ per un prodotto simile. Può essere comodo se state facendo un lavoro in cui vi servono entrambe le mani e quindi potete utilizzare questo speaker come vivavoce, ma ascoltarci la musica equivale a prendere una vecchia radiolina di quelle da 5 mila lire comprate sulle bancarelle del mercato del paese negli anni novanta, sintonizzarle su una radio FM non stabilissima e ascoltare tutto il “rumore” che c’è.

303,RLYPSUKSVC050,Impressive Sound and Portability,"Upon taking out of the box, I was struck by the miniature form, the bright +/- volume buttons and tactile grille. The body is made of sturdy matte plastic and the rear has a belt clip along with a strong detachable magnet to clip onto a t-shirt or thin jacket. This is designed to be worn or clipped into a bag so the design of the clip and magnet serves its purpose well but can also be attached to metal surfaces such as onto a fridge.

In terms of audio quality, I am very surprised at how dynamic it sounds for such a diminutive unit. You obviously won't get wall thumping bass from this, but you can certainly hear it clearly and the vocals in particular come out crisp and clean. Detail is here too as I can make out the breaths from the vocalists. For this form factor, this is the best sounding Bluetooth speaker I have ever heard, so I tip my cap to Nulaxy. You also get a fairly decent throw (soundstage/surround) from this unit which does not sound bottled like most

I have been using this little speaker for the best part of 4 hours and it has worked flawlessly connected to my phone. You have the usual voice prompts to signal connection status and also a triple-beep when you hit max volume. The buttons are clicky but feel solid and positive.

Bluetooth connectivity was also strong as I could take my phone upstairs to the back of the house and still clearly here the audio downstairs which did not skip a beat.

357,R2394N85A45S4U,Tensea Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Screen Protector Case: Elevating Protection and Style,"I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase of the Tensea Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Screen Protector Case, and I can confidently award it a well-deserved 5 stars. This accessory set has not only met but exceeded my expectations in terms of functionality, design, and overall user experience.

One of the standout features of this product is the ""High Responsive Touch"" technology. The hard PC bumper and HD anti-fog tempered glass protective film have effectively addressed my touch troubles. The screen remains highly responsive even in wet conditions, eliminating the need to constantly remove and wipe the screen after activities like showering, exercising, or being caught in the rain. The smooth touch of the 9H tempered glass adds to the overall bright visual experience, making interactions with my Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 seamless and enjoyable.

The inclusion of 5 packs of tempered glass screen protectors and 5 packs of PC protective bumper cases in the multipack is a game-changer. This comprehensive set provides complete protection for my Samsung Galaxy Watch 6, shielding it from unexpected shocks or shatters. The simple and generous design also complements various watch bands, allowing for versatile styling options.

The emphasis on ""Screen Protection"" is evident in the design of the PC bumper, effectively guarding against dust, dirt, scratches, and other potential damages. The precise cutout design ensures a snug fit, granting access to all controls, buttons, and sensors with utmost precision.

Installation has never been easier. The Tensea Samsung Watch 6 cases and screen protectors are a breeze to install and remove, eliminating the hassle of taking off the watch bands. This user-friendly feature adds to the overall convenience of owning and maintaining the protective set.

In conclusion, the Tensea Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Screen Protector Case has proven to be a reliable and stylish companion for my smartwatch. It not only offers top-tier protection but also enhances the overall user experience.

359,R3IDBHQKSOQQGL,Good Protection For A Good Price,"UPDATE: Today is September 10th 2023 and I noticed that my black watch case was cracked (I'm not sure how or when it happened) but my watch is fine which is what really matters. The case did its job and I'm glad I had it on my watch. I uploaded two pictures, one showing the crack or I guess it's a split, and the other picture showing I'm now using the silver watch case because I think it looks nice with the black official Samsung fabric watch band.

I received this product on August 1st and I liked the looks of the contents but seeing as I was waiting for my preordered Galaxy Watch 6 Classic LTE 47mm in black from my carrier I had to put this product off to the side. On August 7th UPS delivered my Galaxy Watch 6 Classic LTE 47mm and after getting the watch setup and connected to my (preordered) Galaxy S23 Ultra 512gb I immediately opened up the package containing the watch cases and grabbed a black one along with one screen protector and the included suction cup.

Screen protector installation: I used a ZEISS glasses cleaner lens wipe that I have to wipe my watch screen clean. Once it was dry (took a few seconds) I inspected the watch face for any dust or lint particles, since I didn't see any I proceeded to getting the screen protector ready to install. I removed the screen protector from the soft white case and grabbed the suction cup and made sure to stick the suction cup on the opposite side of the pull tab that you remove first so you can apply the screen protector to the watch face. I checked again for any dust before I attempted to line up and apply the screen protector. Once I applied the screen protector I pressed down gently for a few seconds and I had to gently use my fingernail to get the suction cup off the screen protector. Once the suction cup was removed I put it back in the box and I noticed a almost have the screen bubble near the top so I gently used my fingernail to lift the edge (at 12 o'clock) and the whole screen protector almost came off so I pressed gently again and had a small bubble that I was able to remove by pressing gently in the middle and sliding my finger outward. I was concerned the adhesive wasn't going to stick but so far the screen protector has stayed in place.

Case Installation: The case was easy to install. I started with the button side and once that was seated properly I started pressing on the left side of the case and I heard a nice little click letting me know the case was properly installed. I looked it over to confirm it was installed correctly and I put my new watch on my wrist.

The case and screen protector seem of good quality and if either gets scraped up there is more than one in the package so it's worth the investment to keep your watch looking new.

I've included two pictures, the first picture  shows how the cases protects the bezel and leaves a little of the bezel exposed so you can rotate it. It's worth noting that rotating the bezel isn't as easy with the case on so you may need an additional bezel ring. I don't mind because after installing my case (different brand) on my GW3 LTE 45mm I got used to using the buttons and swiping the screen.

The second picture shows how the case protects the physical buttons but it doesn't make the buttons harder to press as the case just makes the buttons sit flush  against the case. I'm glad that the case protects the buttons like that because it also protects against an accidental button presses.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IDBHQKSOQQGL,SupaDad,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/6e79b7c9-0687-4c1a-9242-df10604fffae._CR62,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610bfdqONbL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612qISJWBaL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EnaNnnf0L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71OXk-r6HUL._SY88.jpg']",,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2023",True,B0CB5JW9FS,22 people found this helpful,,,

However, there are already nicks on the bumper or case as I call it.  It was nicked within the first two weeks.  The case looks really natural.  When I first saw that it was nicked, I thought that my watched had gotten scratched; that is just how natural it looks.  Did not expect to nick it this quickly, but I can change it out, which is a good thing.  I have included a picture of the scratches where it looks like the paint has come off the case.

378,R103ER2FN5FYBL,Works great!!  Has fast charging and charges through my phone cases with no issues,"This XMANA wireless charger works great and has fast charging.  It charges my phone while its on portrait or horizontal.  It works on both my Samsung S23+ and my iPhone.  For both phones, I have a two-layer phone case and a MagSafe ring adhered to the outside of the case for each phone.  It also charges my Galaxy ear buds 2 pro.  There is a soft padding on the base where you place the phone on the cradle.  The green LED light displays solid when its ready to charge, charging and when its completely charged.  The only time there is was any change in the LED light if there was a charging error, which would cause the light to blink.  I have this at my bedside and the LED light is not too bright.

Like others have already mentioned, this does not include a charging block.  If the company included a charging block, they would just increase the price for the device.  Like cell phones these days, they don't include charging blocks either.  Many people just plug the USB directly into a USB block they already have, or their outlet or surge protector that has USB-C ports.  If one doesn't have these options, it's easy just to purchase a USB-C charging block.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R103ER2FN5FYBL,VP,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2024",False,B0D72SDCQ1,,,,

388,R1YCCYM6KJHQDQ,So close to perfect,"I grabbed this looking for a better bedside option to charge all my things. The simple fact that its MagSafe is great for a rock solid connection. Both my iPhone and Apple
Watch make great connections and I don’t have to worry about disconnection during charging.

The included power brick and charging cord are great and just as powerful as a 20w power cube in my unscientific testing.

This product could be a perfect 5 star, but the iPhone arm which keeps the charger propped up doesn’t lock into place. So when I remove my iPhone from charging, which is again secured by powerful magnets, the arm falls down. If it were to have little nubs to lock the charging arm in place it would be a perfect 5 star product based on charging performance.

Last is that it folds flat for easy travel portability. I’m on the road a lot for my kids sports so this is easy to drop in my bag based on how small it is and I have 1 thing to plug and all my devices are charging.

409,R2NBDMPCW7LETA,Direct Replacement for Nintendo  Straps,"My son likes to chew things. Well, he chewed his original set of these and they didn't really 'fit' any more. Now, these things are already known to be tough to get on and off after a while, but after his gnawing, the original ones really just weren't having it any more. They were tough to get on and even tougher to remove.
These YELUK Wrist Straps are a direct replacement, there's literally no perceptible difference between these and the original Nintendo versions. They fit properly, the little battery level indicator lights work perfectly, and the straps look exactly the same as the originals. Good as new!

They're still not the easiest things to remove, but I think that's always been a bit of a design flaw for these straps, and with this replacement set I certainly don't feel like I'm going to have to break anything to remove them like I did before.

Sometimes with 'off brand' replacements like this, things won't be quite right, there'll be fitment issues or something will just look strange, but after using these I can't imagine a reason to need the more expensive, ""brand"" versions if you need replacements. These are ideal.

417,R24985AY5PLJ3P,Good replacement straps for the Joycons,"*** Please note that this review is for the straps, and NOT the controllers also posted in this listing.

I lost my straps to my Joycons years ago, and recently have been playing some games that require them (specifically WarioWare). I wanted a cheap replacement and got these. They work well - they slide into place and fit perfectly, the straps feel secure, and the two mini shoulder buttons seem to be responsive. There’s no obnoxious branding or anything either, which is a plus.

That being said, it’s probably worth it to just get the regular official Nintendo version. This product comes with two straps for $10, but Nintendo’s official OEM product is only $12 on Amazon (they are currently, as of writing, sold for $6 apiece).

Not to knock this product or anything because it does work as advertised, I would just rather have the official version, especially when it’s only a couple of dollars more.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24985AY5PLJ3P,Hamish,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on April 9, 2024",False,B0CSK9NNWK,,,,

433,R2EGT4Y4CL3SGD,Great quality and fit for Samsung S9+,"Great case for the money.

My nanny asked me to pick up a new leather wallet case for her when she bought her new phone.  I showed her a few options, including this LK case as well as others that were in the $20-$30+ range.  She chose the LK.

I wasn't sure what to expect for a leather case at this price point, but the LK case is on par with some of the more expensive cases out there.  It is sturdy, high quality, looks good, and provides protection around the entire phone.

Others cases feel like cheap cardboard, but this case is thick enough where it doesn't bend from repeated use.  At the same time, it is thin enough to close completely and look sleek.  Having the wallet feature built in is a huge plus as it reduces any chance of forgetting your phone, or dropping your phone because you are carrying too many things in your hands.  Note that the more things you pack into the card slots, then there will be a space between the phone screen and the cover, but that is to be expected.  This is usually noticeable as you pack in wads of cash.  Regardless, it still provides protection as the magnetic flap holds the case closed and the rubber sleeve covers the edges.

There is a built-in rubber sleeve in the case where you put your phone into and it fits great.  It provides protection all around the sides (and back) of your phone while not covering the edge screen.  The fit is secure but easy to get your phone in and out off.  The cutouts for the buttons, headphone jack, and charging port are also a perfect fit and easily accessible while the phone is in the case.

All-in-all, a great case with plenty of protection.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2EGT4Y4CL3SGD,Marc Chin,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on May 9, 2018",True,B0D7LN7FP9,10 people found this helpful,,,

445,RAUIXIRPGPC9E,Indestructibuds,"I got these earbuds originally to replace my old galaxy buds, ufortunately my new kitten decided to drag them off to the cat demension. I didn't want to get another expensive pair just for them to fall to the same fate so, after reading reviews for several buds below $50 dollars, I settled on these.

First of all the fit on them is fairly good, I have rather small ears so finding earbuds that fit them, especially wireless ones, is pretty difficult. The sound quality is ok. For the price it is pretty good, the sound can just be a little quiet sometimes and the tones aren't very rich. Over all pretty good if you want to watch YouTube or Netflix with them, but they might not be the best for music.

The battery life is amazing, I use them for at least 3 hours a day and sometimes overnight and I can go around 2 weeks between charges. Granted, I don't use both at the same time, which does save battery life, but my galaxy buds had to be charged every other day with the same amount of use. However, the Bluetooth connection can be a little finicky at times. They'll sometimes take a pretty long while to connect. Even after putting both buds in the case and closing the lid, the earbuds will stay connected to your phone, therefore you have to completely turn the Bluetooth off if you want to use your phone's speaker/mic.

Now to the best part of all, these things are practically indestructible. I tend to bring my buds with me every day at work. I usually use them when I'm on break or lunch, but since I work at a hardware store, you can imagine some of the abuse they go through. Day to day constantly getting dropped or falling out of my pocket, being knocked around while I lift boxes, lumber, and plywood, and other such abuses. But the worst thing I ever put them through was in my own home. Seeing as how I put important things in my pockets all the time, such as my earbuds, keys, phone etc, you'd think I'd be better at checking them before throwing my clothes in the wash. Unfortunately however, I am not. I managed to put these buds through an entire 70 minute wash cycle, and they came out fine, case and all. I separated the buds from the case and left everything open and spread out to dry for about a day. After that, good as new.

If you need a cheap and sturdy pair of earbuds just for the sake of watching videos or to use while working, I don't think you'd find a better deal. Not that I'd recommend putting them in the washer, but at least you know it can survive it just in case.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RAUIXIRPGPC9E,Charley Golding,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on October 29, 2021",True,B08B5NQ7QZ,73 people found this helpful,,,

The sound is perfect for me the volume goes by how far your phone goes up! You can control the volume up with the right ear bud and turn the volume down with the left ear bud so you don't have to touch your phone if you don't want to! You can pause a video/ with a touch or answer phone calls with the ear buds too! It tells the battery life of your earbuds on your phone when you look at the wifi connection which is great for me!

455,R2ZPQ6VPXHW94C,"Has unique features like an SD card slot, aux input, cool lights (or none), usb C, good sound.","Bluetooth speakers seem to be a dime a dozen these days, but this one has some cool features others don't.  The most noticeable are the lights on the top.  Take a look at the video I posted that shows the 7 settings and gives you an overall look at the speaker.  I prefer the lights off, but you may like the colors, especailly the moving colors.

Behind the little rubber door that stays attached when open are 3 jacks.  One is a usb C port for charging (cable included), and aux 1/8"" jack (no cable included) and  a TF card slot that I haven't seen in others.  I'm sure there are times when you don't want to deal with bluetooth so if you put your music on a micro card you can keep the speaker self contained.

At first I didn't like the sound much, but then I pressed the DSP button and there are 3 eq settings to choose from.  I like bass and one of the settings gave me the bass I wanted.

The speaker has voice prompts that tell you when it's on, when bluetooth is connected etc... .  The speaker quickly and easily connected to my iphone.  You can keep your phone a pretty good distance away from the speaker and it stays connected.  There's also a warning if your battery is getting low.  I ran this speaker for a few hours and it was still going.

The plus and minus switches that I initially thought were just for volume also function as a next track and previous track button respectively.  Short press for volume and long press for track functions.

It also comes with a cord you can tie to the built in loop to make it easier to carry.  It's a pretty good size speaker so someone with smaller hands will like this.

The speaker is built well.  One of the first things my wife did was accidentally knock off a sink onto a tile floor.  Not a scratch.

456,R3GP998I36J75C,Small but mighty. This speaker delivered beyond my expectations!,"Geektop Arcane A7 Bluetooth Speaker.

What's in the box:
-Manual/Quick Start Guide.
-The Speaker Unit.
-USB C male to USB A male charging cable.
-Lanyard.

Button layout:
-Power Button/RGB cycle button
-Volume Up/Next Track
-DsP/Equalizer key
-Volume down/Previous Track
-Play/Pause Button.

I/O:
-USB Type C female port for charging the speaker unit.
-3.5mm Aux port
-TF Card Slot.

Pairing this speaker with any Bluetooth audio device is within seconds, once successful, speaker is good to go!
Speaker operates on Bluetooth v5.1 protocol.
Hands free calling is also supported by this speaker.

I have to say I am very much impressed by sound output of this speaker! I never really expect the level of sound quality that comes out of this speaker.
Pro Tip: for best listening experience, lay this speaker in a horizontal position with the side of the speaker where the controls are, facing down. The mini woofer side of the speaker can be turned towards or away from your listening angle depending on how ambient you want you music to be.

The default equalizer setting that this speaker comes with gives the best audio output right out the box (in my opinion), though I tried out the other 2 equalizer settings available but both were flat & didn't pump out as much bass & clarity as the default EQ settings did.

Battery life is very impressive. I used this to play music for 11 straight hrs from full charge.
Note that how long the battery will stay on depends on how loud the music being played is amongst other factors.
Charging time from near empty to full takes about roughly 3hrs!

Another great feature on this speaker unit is the ability to connect audio from an external source via 3.5mm cable to Aux port.
Also this speaker support music playback from a SD Card.

Audio Quality:
This speaker has a frequency response of 120hz - 18khz & a signal to noise ratio of 82db which means that this speaker is able to output a clean audio with a very decent  balance of bass & treble without any noticeable form of distortion at high volumes.

Overall, this Bluetooth speaker reaaaally packs a punch for something this portable! Produces music loud enough to start a house party (not the neighborhood disturbing kind of course!).
This is great value for money!
I highly recommend this speaker to anyone looking for a Bluetooth speaker that doesn't cost a whole lot but also delivers very impressive quality audio!
I will also be recommending this directly to friends!

This speaker delivers beyond my expectations, I am very impressed.

473,R154SM7N4F3ZBD,A must have FaceTime accessory!,"This product has absolutely changed my life for the better which I can't say about a majority of products I use!

The main reason I bought it was because I needed a more efficient way to FaceTime with my family every night. Typically when I get home from work, I head to the kitchen to cook dinner while I let my young son play next to me. His grandparents always call when I'm cooking which leaves me chasing him around with a phone for 30 minutes.

The most incredible thing is that this gimbal has AI tracking and all I need to do is open FaceTime, point the phone at my son and it'll track him while he moves around the kitchen and talks to his grandparents. That means I can focus my time on cooking. I can't say enough good things about how amazing this feature is. I also love that it has a ring light to let you know that the tracking is enabled so you don't need to keep looking back at the phone. This helps because often times I'm staring at the back of the phone when it's tracking my son around the kitchen and I can't see what's happening on the screen.

I did some research and there are a number of other phone gimbals on the market but this one seems to be the best all around with largest variety of features.

474,R1FQ2H1NXG516C,The Flow Pro is Impressive,"I recently purchased the Insta360 Flow Pro to capture special moments with my kids. As a father who loves to document my family's adventures but doesn’t own a professional camera, having a reliable mobile gimbal like the Flow Pro has been a game-changer.

The first thing that blew me away was the incredible tracking. All I need to do is turn on my iPhone camera app and start filming. Whether I'm recording my kids running around the park or capturing their school plays, the Flow Pro ensures they always stay in frame. No more shaky footage, which is a huge plus when you're trying to keep up with energetic little ones!

The setup was straightforward, and the one-step deployment made it easy to start shooting right away. I appreciate that I don't have to be a tech wizard to use it effectively. The joystick, zoom wheel, and all the controls are intuitive, allowing me to focus on capturing the moment rather than fumbling with complicated settings.

As a parent on the go, I value how portable and lightweight the Flow Pro is. It fits easily into my pocket or backpack, so I'm always ready to capture spontaneous moments wherever we are. The battery life is impressive, allowing me to shoot for hours without worrying about running out of power. It's perfect for those long family outings and vacations.

Overall, the Insta360 Flow Pro has become an essential part of my video-making toolkit. It helps me create beautiful memories that I can cherish and share with family and friends. Whether you're a parent like me or just someone who loves capturing life's moments, I highly recommend the Flow Pro.

Cet appareil est tout bonnement idéal pour réaliser des films de qualité avec son iPhone. La stabilité est parfaite et le suivi automatique de personnes est tout juste fabuleux.

Ce produit est à tout point de vue supérieur au modèle DJI (je suis pourtant un grand fan de la marque pour mes drones) et à son prédécesseur Insta360.

478,RW5RJRL9Q80R5,スマホジンバルの決定版、初めてのInsta360製品としても🙆‍♀️,"Flow無印とProで買換えレベルの差異はありませんが、これから買うならPro一択です。

Andoridユーザーであっても「トラッキング・リングライト」と「360度無限パントラッキング」はとても有用。
外カメラで自撮りする際にトラッキングされているか分かりますし、パン方向を気にする必要がないので気軽に設置することができます。
自撮りでなくても手首が楽になるよう好きな持ち方ができ、タイムラプス設定をカスタムすれば360度、ぐるっと撮影することができます。
新品の単品価格に差がないこと、ビデオライトもMagsafeプレートでは使用できないので、積極的に無印版を選ぶ必要はないでしょう。

ハードウェア：
3軸ジンバルであり、軸間の距離が短いこともあってかジンバルロックやカメラにアーム部分が映り込むことが起こります。特に縦撮りや正面アイレベル以外の撮影をする場合は、どのように撮影するか持ち方などを考えたり、実際に試し撮りしてみて支障がないか検証する必要があります。
またコールドシューはワイヤレスマイクを想定して作られており、位置や機構があればビデオライト使えただろうなと思えてしまう点に惜しさを感じます。
内蔵三脚は不安定なので、特に屋外撮影では別途三脚を用意したい印象。本当におまけ程度の認識が良いです。
不満はリングライト。
Dockkitで動作しているときはリングライトが iPhone と連携しているか判断するものとなりますが、Insta360アプリ内であればジンバルとアプリが連携しているか画面を見れば分かるので、トラッキング状態を示すよりも撮影中かどうか示す設定があれば良かったかと思います。

アプリ：
Insta360アプリは神
Flowには被写体の自動ズーム機能が用意されていることもあり、手軽にプロカメラマンのような撮影を可能にします。
ただし自動ズームは自動で有効化されない仕様なので、トラッキング開始したと同時に有効化する設定があれば良かったかなと思います。

また動画いくつか選んで、それらしい動画に自動編集するAI機能がとても優秀。年に数回しか作らないホームビデオなら文句なしです。
Insta360以外の動画素材も使えるので、ドローンや他カメラのタイムラプスも組み合わせていくと、今まで撮り溜めしていた映像をカップ麺を作る時間で仕上げることができます。
AI編集だけであればInsta360製品買わずに使えるはずなので、まずはアプリをダウンロードして「編集する」をお試しあれ。

Insta360製品の中でも撮影の簡単さはONEやGoシリーズが上ですが 、Flowシリーズは録画データを insp や insv 形式から書き出す必要がなく、書出し日=撮影日にならないのが良いです。
撮影を楽にしたいか、写真・動画管理を楽したいか、ここは好みが分かれるところですがInsta360ワールドの良さを知るきっかけには良い製品です。

iPhoneユーザー向け：
Insta360 アプリなしでも簡易的に人物の追跡ができる・撮影など操作ができることが Dockkit 対応の恩恵。
1. 明日 Insta360 が倒産してもジンバルは使い続けられること
2. 標準のカメラアプリなら Apple Watch でプレビューできること(※Insta360アプリのWatchアプリはFlow対応していない)
3. 空間ビデオでジンバルが使える・自撮りができること
これらが利点ですが、基本的には Insta360 ライブモードを都度使う必要がなくなったくらいの認識がよく、基本的にはInsta360アプリを使う方が確実です。
Dockkitは人物は追跡できますが、動物や物はInsta360アプリじゃないとならず、その操作性の良さもInsta360アプリが段違いに上です。

下記の英語版の公式ブログの方でしかトリガーがDockkitトラッキングの開始・終了という情報を見かけておらず、Insta360アプリを使用しない場合の情報が散らかっている印象です。
サードパーティ製カメラアプリの挙動について保証はしないのは仕方ないですが、現時点での iOS 純正カメラアプリを使用した場合についてチュートリアル情報に載せていて欲しかったかと思います。
> タイトル：Best Smartphone Shots: Insta360 Flow Pro Tips and Tricks For Beginners
> Pro Tip: Press the Trigger Button once to start/stop tracking.

他の方が述べているようにうまく接続できていないことはあり、その場合はジンバル再起動など試すことが稀にあります。
（その場合は撮影ボタンやリングライトなども機能しない）
iOS 純正カメラアプリを使用する場合の話になりますが、 iPhone が複数台ありデバイスごと切り替えて使う場合は都度 NFC タップが必要そうな挙動をします。

483,R3NPC2ZKNYK84V,Exceptional Durability and Performance – A Must-Have for Apple Users!,"As an experienced reviewer with a vast background in evaluating tech products, I'm thoroughly impressed with this USB C to Lightning Cable set. Having rigorously tested it with various Apple devices, including the iPhone 14 Pro Max, 13 Pro, 12 mini, 11, X, XS, XR, 8 Plus, and various iPad models, I can confidently say that it stands out in the market for several reasons.

Firstly, the Apple MFi Certification is crucial. This certification ensures that the cable is built to Apple's exacting standards, offering not just compatibility but also the assurance of safety and optimal charging performance. It's a key factor that distinguishes this cable from numerous uncertified options flooding the market.

The 10ft length of each cable in this 2Pack set offers exceptional convenience. Whether you're using your device in bed, at your desk, or even in a larger space where an outlet isn't nearby, this length provides ample flexibility without compromising charging speed or efficiency.

Speaking of speed, these cables support fast charging. When used with a compatible USB-C Power Delivery charger, they significantly reduce the time required to charge your devices. This feature is particularly beneficial for power users or in situations where time is of the essence.

Durability is another standout aspect. The cables are robust and designed to withstand the rigors of daily use. The stress points near the connectors are well-reinforced, reducing the risk of fraying or damage that often plagues lesser-quality cables.

Lastly, the type C port support is a forward-thinking feature, aligning well with the latest trends in technology and ensuring compatibility with a wide range of current and future devices.

In conclusion, this 2Pack of USB C to Lightning Cables is a top-tier choice for any Apple user. It combines length, durability, fast charging capability, and MFi certification into an affordable package, making it an essential accessory for your Apple devices. Highly recommended for its superior quality and reliability.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NPC2ZKNYK84V,Dan,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2023",True,B0BG7XSL4X,2 people found this helpful,,,

495,R1OMQ57GURYO0E,Surprisingly long cable makes this more useful than I was expecting,"This is a nice little USB hub that works well with my Mac Mini by offering a few more of the most needed ports in an easy to connect hub. The 12” attached cable was surprisingly longer than I expected it to be (don’t recall the item listing offering that info). As a result, this hub is easier to position on my desk where others have been too close to the computer for easy use. This extra cable could also be helpful for those using it with a laptop or sharing with others in a presentation situation. Also, the wider, squarish design works better on the desk and doesn’t flop around like another compact hub I have. Attachment points on both sides also give more space around the ports, so it's easier to connect and disconnect if using several ports.

The finish is slightly lighter but close to the current Apple graphite color while also complementing the classic Apple silver finish. Fit and finish is very nice and the unit is solid, no rattles, with the cord firmly wedded to the unit and just enough flex. All the USB ports worked as expected and the card reader immediately recognized the SD card and fits firmly in the slot with no vagueness as to how it should insert.

The various connection types are marked in small font printed on the unit so you can at least insure you're using the right outlet for your needs. Sure it’d be nice if they were all powered USB c and 3 connections but that’s just not physically possible from a little add-on, unpowered hub.

This device has been a game-changer for me in terms of connectivity and data management.

The variety of ports offered in this multiport adapter is something I truly appreciate. With 1 HDMI port, 1 power-out USB C charging port, SD/MicroSD card reader, 2 USB A 3.0 ports, 2 USB A 2.0 ports, and 1 USB C 3.0 data port, I can finally connect all my peripherals in one place without having to deal with a mess of cables and separate adapters.

The 4k@60Hz HDMI output has been a lifesaver for me as a video editor, allowing me to effortlessly connect my MacBook Pro to an external monitor for a seamless, ultra-high-definition experience. It has made editing and reviewing my projects a much more enjoyable and efficient process.

The data transfer capabilities of this USB C Hub have been phenomenal. The 20MB/s SD/TF card reader, along with the USB 3.0 and 2.0 ports, enables me to transfer data from my devices with ease, making my workflow smoother and more efficient.

498,R2XJ2II307GVC2,Works perfectly with my PCs and my Samsung Galaxy S22.,"I use this hub with my laptop PCs and with my Samsung Galaxy S22 smartphone to provide additional ports for mouse, keyboard, flash drive, and for micro-SD card access.

PROS:
It works with my PCs and with my Samsung Galaxy S22 smartphone.

If you attach a USB-A (male) to USB-C (female) to the USB-C plug, this works perfectly as a USB & SD/micro-SD hub, however it won’t support HDMI out (because PCs only have that capability through their USB-C ports).  That’s no fault of this hub.

It has a USB-C port that you can optionally use to attach a charger for use with higher powered devices like USB-powered hard drives.  This also lets you charge your host device if it is capable of charging through the USB-C port (like my Galaxy S22).

The hub has SD and micro-SD slots that work well.  In addition to the obvious benefit, this is nice because you can insert a micro-SD card into it and leave it inserted so that the hub always has extra storage and can be easily carried in a laptop-PC bag. An inserted micro-SD-card only protrudes about 0.25” (5mm).  An inserted SD card protrudes about 0.75” (15mm).

The hub is small and attractive.  It looks nice on a desktop and fits nicely into my laptop-PC bag.

The hub is metal, which helps dissipate heat and should improve longevity.

CONS:
None.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XJ2II307GVC2,Dave Rave,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on June 30, 2024",False,B0D5XSTWNT,,,,
499,R2737ZN330CO3Y,"Multiple ports, great functionality","I use the USB C Hub to connect my laptop to an external monitor display. The hub is a versatile and essential tool for expanding my laptop's connectivity. It offers a variety of ports including HDMI, USB 3.0, USB 2.0, SD/TF card readers, and more, making it incredibly convenient for both professional and personal use.

Pros:
Multiple Ports: The array of ports covers most connectivity needs, allowing you to connect multiple devices simultaneously. It features four USB-A ports (two USB 3.0 and two USB 2.0), a dedicated USB-C port, and a 100W power USB-C charging port.
High-Speed Data Transfer: The USB 3.0 ports ensure fast data transfer rates.
4K HDMI Output: The HDMI port supports 4K video output, making it ideal for presentations and media viewing.
Compact Design: Its sleek and portable design makes it easy to carry around.
Convenient Charging: The 100W power USB-C charging port is great for powering any laptop and ensures your devices stay powered without taking up an extra port on your computer.

Cons:
Single Display Output: Though this is very clear in the directions, it does lack the capability to add a second display via a DisplayPort or second HDMI port.

Then I went ahead and plugged in my thumb drives to see if I could get Files off of them to the iPad which worked great then I went ahead and plugged in a wireless mouse in one of the USB ports, and it worked perfectly on my iPad, which was really cool and it gave me a split screen between my television and my iPad with stage manager.

Also, what was really cool as it was in fullscreen on the television if you’ve ever mirrored your iPad to an Apple TV you know that it doesn’t fill the screen up, but this filled the screen up and that’s what was a big surprise.. .

546,R3V3N1UDHLQ6CX,One of the Few Controllers That's Worth the Price,"The 8Bitdo Ultimate C 2.4g Wireless Controller with Turbo Function and Rumble Vibration is a game-changer that is a testament to style and functionality.  It has upped my gaming experience with its exceptional build qua--  Oh, wait a moment.  Sorry, I forgot I wasn't an AI.  Allow me to try again.  *ahem*

For any game controller, there are five aspects that matter most: comfort, connectivity, battery life, durability and responsiveness.  To sum up for those who want a quick review, this controller scored very high in each category.  I absolutely recommend it.  However, for those that wish for more details, they are offered below.

Comfort (9/10) -- It is very comfortable to hold.  Of the many controllers that I've held in my life, this one is comparably much more comfortable than most.  The only reason that I didn't offer the highest score is because I'm certain there are people out there who will find it either too small or too big.  To be fair, I'm not certain that there are any controllers that can universally offer proper comfort to every single person.

Connectivity (9/10) -- The controller connected immediately and without any issue.  Furthermore, it stayed connected no matter where I walked around in the room.  When I wished to disconnect or turn off the controller, it was extremely easy to do so.  The only thing I didn't like was that each controller requires its own dongle to connect.  It's a bit of an inconvenience.  I like the idea of connecting many controllers to the same system without issue, but perhaps that's just wishful thinking for now.

Battery Life (10/10) -- This is perhaps the most surprising feature of the controller, as it seems to last for an unusually long time.  In fact, I haven't ever had the battery run out.  I do charge it every once in a while, but not obsessively so.  I expected it to fail at some point and it hasn't yet.

Durability (9/10) -- While the controller is plastic, it feels quite durable.  It lacks that flimsy quality that many wireless controllers seem to have (as if dropping it the wrong way would break or chip something off).  I don't think it's deserving of a perfect 10 score because I don't think it would necessarily survive being thrown multiple times across the room by angry gamers (though whether or not that actually matters is up to you).

Responsiveness (10/10) -- I used the controller with multiple games with the explicit purpose of testing its responsiveness and was both surprised and pleased.  Every movement and button press happened instantaneously and they seemed to be the same whether the controller was plugged in or wireless.

Value (9/10) -- I have added value as an additional category for those who are wondering if the controller is actually worth the price.  After all, even if a controller is amazing, if it costs $1,000 -- is it really worth it?  In this case, it's definitely worth it.  It seems to sit around $30, which is more than fair given its competition.  It's simply not worth paying a few dollars less for something significantly worse.  This controller is worth the price that's being asked.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3V3N1UDHLQ6CX,J.

547,R267VEMQX4ZG17,The Bunnii's Verdict is In! YES GIMME MORE.,"Okay so let's jump into this review. I am a Semi truck driver, so my stuff needs to be able to take a beating lol. I have a laptop and like to play FPS games when I'm in my down time. We'll go over some pros and some cons and then I'll give my personal taste.

Pros:
- Lightweight, but not cheap o.o
- great connectivity
- the design fits comfortably in my hands
- wired/wireless play, and it charges while wired :D
- easy to clean and keep clean :3

Cons:
- it doesn't connect to my phone :( or am I stupid?
- first connect is a lil weird
- I lose the dongle sometimes, it's small okay?
- the thumb grip feels funny, but that's a me issue.
- no backlight, sucks when you play in the dark >_>

Ultimately: this controller is great for the price. I play Destiny 2...which is a pretty intense game for most controllers. I didnt wanna fork out the $250 for a purple elite controller, or the $60. I do love that it's rechargeable by type C (andriod) and that you can find that just about anywhere to replace the cable if it breaks. I do wish that there was a little slot or something on the back of the controller for the dongle, because it's small and my KW likes to try and eat it. 10/10 I would buy this again, or the updated version since that one is out now. But if you're on a budget, this works great for PC gaming and responds very well when taking down Nezy or the Witness ^_^ it's also really good for NFS Heat, No Man's Sky, Grounded, ect.

548,R4ZZMP75984IS,Better than most high end controllers.,"I've been using an Xbox controller to PC game for a couple of years; if you search online it's the best way to go for quality and price. Two things I couldn't stand about it: the drift and the loud clicking buttons. The clicking...that crackle of hard plastic crashing onto more hard plastic...the worst sound ever conceived if you're a late night gamer with a sleeping baby and Mrs. in the house. A side note: I also tried the PS5 controller, but the battery life was lacking.

I'm so happy I finally found a replacement.
Pros:
This controller doesn't drift.
It feels great in my hands; very similar to a Nintendo Switch Pro controller.
It feels as if it's made of quality materials; not that cheap hollow feel.
I've had no issues with response or feedback.
The buttons feel great with no sticking.
The battery life is amazing.
The sound: the controller is quiet. No more loud clicking of buttons or sticks.
Setup is simple. I'm using windows and I had to re read the instructions because I plugged in the dongle and it did everything for me...I thought I was missing steps!
Turning on and off is really easy; which, by the way, was another complaint of my previous controller. Aside from the quieter buttons, the best part is the price which is much cheaper than the competiton out there.
I usually prefer the color my controllers to mimic the system; I wish there was a black offered during my purchase, but the sea breeze green-looking color is actually quite refreshing.

Cons/Neutral:
No complaints as of yet and it's been a week.
(Neutral) I'll say the rumble feature...I haven't really given it my attention; I own every current system and only the PS5 has really wowed me in the rumble feedback department so I don't pay much attention to it when I'm on my other systems.

I'm not the most fluent in PC gaming and, as a casual gamer, my expectations versus experience may differ from other hardcore gamers but hopefully my review will help someone out there. If it also helps, here are my PC specs:

549,R3LA9947A6M34Z,Very nice wireless controller.,"I got these initially to play on my docked steam deck.

550,R3CSZAP3EG0L1R,Far better than the $ it costs - a detailed review with feature breakdown,"TL;DR Buzzy haptics and a bit loose bumpers don't outweigh the killer ergonomics, analog triggers, and features for the price. Well worth the money.

I was sick of bluetooth controllers disconnecting so I opted for the wireless USB variety. The controller claims it will also just do straight bluetooth and I have no reason to doubt it.

PROS:
* great ergonomics - feels really natural in the hand, almost GameCube level comfort. The stippled texture under the grips feels really nice. The sharp edge along the bottom is actually really satisfying design.
* battery - I charge it only occasionally. Lasts ages. USB-c.
* USB dongle. Bluetooth sucks (I mean in general, not this controller). I love how reliable it has been with the wireless USB
* analog triggers - feel great. Good weight. Thoughtful design around the housing so they don't accidentally press when you put it down (PS4 controllers)
* color - it's a very nice desaturated lavender. The photos on amazon are a little more saturated than it is in person, but it's still very nice.
* build - all of the important parts feel really solid. The housing is very tight. It has nice weight. I've pounded the buttons, sticks, triggers etc while button-mashing my way through spiderman and it's doing great.

PRICE CONCESSIONS:
* no gyro aim / touchpad / back paddles - but those aren't found even on a lot of first party *cough xbox* controllers.
* sticks aren't Hall Effect - they might get stick drift. Just like every other controller.
* materials - It's plastic. The buttons are very plastic. The sticks are very plastic (but have good grip and weight, no jiggling). The D-pad feels slightly washy (but has nice click), the button labels are this oversized stretched white font that looks not great.

CONS:
* the bumpers - they are a little loose. They're not a deal-breaker, but given the tight tolerances of every other button (especially the great analog triggers) they should be better.
* haptics - the vibration motor is too powerful. Or maybe it's not seated well. When haptics trigger it's very buzzy, if you death grip the controller then it feels like normal haptics but if you're holding it with a normal relaxed grip it's loud.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CSZAP3EG0L1R,Kent Broadbent,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-1oK6OByL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HPbN51CnL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IYn++b6QL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XKi5J80OL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fzGgvPAHL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gApfNwuQL._SY88.jpg']",,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2024",True,B0C2V6JLNJ,12 people found this helpful,,,
551,R249QK8RZ0YPOB,Bought 2 years ago.  Still works just fine.,"I mostly use this controller to play games on Steam on a PC.  The pros.  1. Has nice hand feel.  I have smaller hands but I think the size is probably good for many hand sizes.  The controller definitely feels more like a switch controller, which is a little more smoother shaped.
2. Battery life/time.  I turn off vibration and this probably tripped the battery time.  Even after using it regularly for 2 years, it's still holding charge just fine.
3. You can charge while playing if needed.  Some controllers don't do this.
4. Can't run headset from controller.  Though to be fair, I'm pretty sure you can't do this for any PC wireless controller.  And I've not got it to work with an official wired Xbox controller either so.  Not sure it's a valid complaint.
5. The center button illumination isn't too intense. Doesn't blind me or distract when using.  It's just a basic white illumination.  Perfect.
6. Times out and turns off with no activity for 10 min.  Better than a 5 min time out. And it reconnects quickly.
7. The backside is textured.  Easier to grip.
8. Xbox thumb caps fit on joystick. Despite the design looking like a switch controller, switch caps are too small and do not fit.  So fyi.
9. After 2 years it still looks new.  I take good care of it, use a stand, and wipe it down occasionally, but yeah.  It does still look new.  No worn spots.

Cons:  1. can't turn off vibration on the controller itself (I turn off in game or via steam).
2. No battery indicator.  I always have to guess if I think it needs charged or not.  But because the battery life is so long (with vibrate off) I've actually never had it die while I was using it.
3. The plastic is pleasant but not as nice as the soft grip kind that feel a little like silicone.  But those also stain and discolor.  So this one is a mixed pro/con.
4. Occasionally I get drops in connection. It's like the controller just turns off.  I don't think it's from low battery because I just click that center button and it's back on and stays on.  Every time it has disconnected it's been this issue of the controller turning off.  Which makes me think it's not registering activity and going to sleep.  Hard to say.  It's rare.  Probably happens once every 40 hrs of game play though it's been happening more lately (controller is 2 years old now).",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R249QK8RZ0YPOB,Dane'lle,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2024",True,B0C2V3QPN7,15 people found this helpful,,,
552,R1NYJM0F1WNF98,High quality controller,"Though it lacks connectivity to the switch, this serves as an excellent PC gamepad and the 2.4ghz connection is fast, far-reaching and reliable.  The sticks are high quality and though they are traditional joysticks that could be subject to drift it's only if the controller itself is low quality. Drift was hardly an issue on controllers of the past, and hopefully this one holds up.  For being wireless and cheap, it feels relatively premium and works well.  My least favorite thing is the gripped rear handles -- it doesn't provide and real traction and just feels weird. Smooth plastic would've been better.

I have read that people say it’s “rough” though i find it comfortable and useful. It gives the product a premium feel and you can tell there was thought behind it. This level of quality is normally seen in more expensive controllers. I initially thought it would be too small for my hands because of the pictures but it fits great.

554,R3OY88HGHE07QH,Great Budget PC Controller!,"I wasn't sure at first that buying something cheap would be good, as many budget controllers usually get bad reviews. But this one has been great. Long battery life, excellent connection, and no problems. So far, no stick drift issues. I can play all my games that use the controller. But, I haven't tried these controllers with an android device or see it can be used on a gaming console.

The USB receiver has gotten an update. I hope they'll give more firmware in the future.

Just the fact that the controller can play up to 25 hours is fantastic. It uses a USB charging cable which comes in the box, is wonderful. But you can use your own as well.

What's cool is it has a turbo button that you can when playing martial art games like Street Fighter or playing shoot'em ups.

I hope the controller will last a long time, but even if it doesn't, I'll buy another again because of the long battery life and price.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OY88HGHE07QH,Joe,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/e4a16ac1-ec7e-4d5d-ae47-47b57d99e7e8._CR0,0,500,500_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2024",True,B0C2V3QPN7,,,,

558,R3MRF1693S4G80,BUY IT NOW!,"I one hundred percent recommend the Hyzom WiFi repeater. Me and my newly wedded wife moved into a small house next to some friends of ours. However, we did not have any internet connection and no way to watch our shows, movies, or sport channels. The phone service is not the best at our place either, so watching things on my phone was out of the question. I was not wanting to pay for a whole WiFi network plan since it is so expensive, so I looked into some internet extenders. After talking to my neighbors and getting their okay to extend off their network, I bought this repeater to boost off of their router.
We only had one problem: their house is over 200 yards away. I knew there was no way it could reach the router from there, but I thought we would give it a try. I unboxed the repeater, plugged it in, and followed the instructions. The instructions were very straight forward, which was a great help, as I am not too bright when it comes to putting things together or making things work. I followed the instructions step by step, and to my surprise, it connected to the wifi. My phone connected immediately, so the next step was to try the TV which has a firestick with it.
I followed the same process to connect the TV to the repeater, and it was all working smoothly. Now we are able to watch our shows and sport channels without having the hassle of paying for an extra internet bill. Paying for this repeater definitely saved us a lot of money!
Here are some things that are great about this repeater: First of all, it reaches throughout the entire house. The strength is the same in every single room, and we have no trouble with buffering or blocking videos. The power tends to go out at our house a few times, so I am looking forward to seeing how this affects the extender. Secondly, the repeater is very small and white, so it is very easy to conceal and it does not get in the way of our decorations or furniture. Thirdly, the repeater is listed at a very affordable price, especially for those who are not looking to pay for an extra bill. Fourthly, this repeater does not interfere with the connection at our neighbor’s house. A lot of previous repeaters have slowed down the internet speed all together, causing both the original router and the extender to be extremely slow. Last but not least, the range of the extender is quite surprising. Even before I reach home, as I drive down the road, my phone connects to the internet.
To anyone who has read this entire review, if you are having trouble with your internet connection being slow, or trouble getting it to reach all the rooms in your home, I highly recommend this extender. I have recommended it to my boss at work, and she is planning to purchase one as well, as her two story house can take a lot of wifi to be able to reach the entire house.

566,R39EKZK9QH37NF,Very Surprised on how well the Range Extender works,"Actually TRULY AMAZED. I had purchased a 3 piece bundle of Range extenders at 3 times the total cost of the HYZOM.

The easy instructions and user-friendly interface for the printer made the process of setting it up a snap. This printer's adaptability is one of the reasons it stands out from the crowd. Numerous devices, such as my Mac, Windows PC, iPhone, and Android devices, may be connected to it without any difficulty. I am able to print labels on the move, regardless of whether I am working from my home office, a coffee shop, or even when I am traveling, because of the amount of interoperability that is available. I can confirm the dependability and effectiveness of this printer since I have been using it for a number of weeks now. The print quality is great, with labels that are crisp and clear, which ensures that major carriers such as the United States Postal Service, United Parcel Service, and FedEx will accurately scan and track the packages.

Compatible with a range of platforms including Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, and various e-commerce platforms like Amazon, eBay, Shopify, and Etsy, this printer offers unparalleled versatility.

Setup was a breeze - I was up and running within minutes on my laptop, thanks to the intuitive installation process and clear video instructions provided on a USB key. The compatibility with both Bluetooth and USB connectivity means I can effortlessly switch between devices depending on my needs, whether it's printing labels from my laptop computer or directly from my smartphone or tablet.

One of the standout features for me is the crisp and clear thermal printing quality. Each label comes out with precision and clarity, ensuring that important shipping information is always legible and professional. This has significantly reduced errors and improved the overall presentation of my packages, enhancing customer satisfaction.

The seamless integration with major shipping carriers like USPS and UPS streamlines the shipping process further. I can easily generate and print shipping labels directly from their respective platforms, saving me valuable time and effort.

Another aspect that sets this printer apart is its compact and sleek design, making it a perfect fit for my small office space, especially since there are no label feeding tray in the back of the printer, but everything is integrated inside it.

580,R1EMZ0TNDL7RE5,"High quality, makes life easy, good idea for small business","Absolutely love my new shipping label printer! As a small business owner juggling multiple online platforms (Amazon, Etsy, you name it!), this printer has been a total game-changer. It's incredibly easy to set up and use – I had it running in minutes, even with my limited tech skills. The fact that it works seamlessly with both my MacBook and iPhone is a huge plus for my on-the-go lifestyle.

Printing 4x6 labels is a breeze, and the quality is crisp and professional. No more smudged ink or wasted labels! Plus, it's compatible with all the major shipping carriers, so I don't have to worry about formatting issues.

If you're a fellow e-commerce entrepreneur looking to streamline your shipping process, I highly recommend giving this thermal label printer a try. It's a small investment that pays off big time in efficiency and peace of mind.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EMZ0TNDL7RE5,JK MILESTONES LLC,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/d1185ec5-32ea-4659-a157-810f07708274._CR0,26.0,281,281_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024",True,B0D9MJXGL2,One person found this helpful,,,
581,R20NQ53NQWZXUN,Narrow flexibility but functional.,"This is a decent thermal printer and the instructional videos noted on their manual are questionable considering the QR codes included takes you to a Google Drive. I watched a couple of the videos for simple setup and immediately deleted them from my drive, and chose to block the files to be safe. Either way, the only way you can use this is via bluetooth, or by hooking up the included printer cable to your computer which would require installing software (I'm assuming via the included flash drive) on your personal computer, and I'm not going to do that. I only want to print from my phone via Bluetooth, and have to do so with their app.

Most of it is pretty self-explanatory and easy to follow, but the integration and some commands are still in another language and I couldn't figure out how to change that setting. Either way, you're able to print via pdf, image, label, or via template. I couldn't get the template screen to show anything, and had more success with the image print than all other settings. The nice thing is, it has some flexibility for other labels, and you can change the sizes for those via the Label printing menu. Although, I don't have other thermal labels to test that out at the moment, but I'm glad that's a possibility as I often print labels for family events and other types of packaging.

The main loading options are pretty easy, you can run it through the back via a flat stack of labels. Otherwise, there is a roll holder inside, to be able to store your labels and not have to worry about fumbling with it behind the machine. This is the ultimate space saver, as the printer is a bit larger than expected. If space is an issue, I recommend using it via a roll is definitely more ideal. Also, if you decide to have a flat stack of labels that run from behind the printer, make sure it's at the right angle and distance to where it won't start peeling labels as it pulls through the feeder.

There are no gradations of color if you decide to print images, as you can see, you have to make sure there are solid lines and straight black and white contrast in order to be able to see the image. I did notice a line around the beginning of each of my prints where it may not have heated up enough, so I will troubleshoot that if it continues over time and becomes a bothersome issue.

609,RYMC3YC4JOZDG,Amazing with a few fixable problems,"Here are the pros and cons of these headphones that I've found

Pros
The battery lasts forever. I turned them on about an hour before I went into work and they finally died about 10 minutes before my 12 hour shift was over.
Sound quality is really really good
The range is honestly surprising. I can go almost a whole room further away from my phone than most other headphones I've bought

Cons
The control box/battery box thing on the forehead starts to hurt after a few hours,and would probably eventually rub a bald spot onto your head, but both of those are easily fixable by stuffing some padding into the band in between the box and your head.
If you wear glasses, the band kind of squeezes your ears against them, which kind of hurts and will make you readjust it alot
The speakers will move around inside the band, so you'll have to readjust them every time you put it on and sometimes while you're wearing then
The band will slip off your head or down over your eyes constantly, though that just might be a me thing, since I've always had that problem with headbands

There was a small issue with the shipping. The products packaging box was put into a packing envelope for shipping, which did not provide enough protection.

621,R29BV1AX1SN0CM,Just a tad short of 5 stars for petty reasons,"Even though Amazon doesn't allow fractions, I'm awarding 4.5 stars.
Actually leaning toward 4.75 stars (1 of 2 issues to do with delivery.

The 'kit' is quite nice, albeit small bottles; much prefer 4 manageable
spray bottles over one 'too-tall' hard-to-hold bottle...which is what I
replaced with this set.  Not positive of the specific ingredients, but I
didn't smell any alcohol, which can be not only ineffective on various
types of today's screens; but certain material strongly warns against it.

My 'petty' detriments:  (product) the best microfiber cloths in any screen
cleaning kit I've owned to date, but still woefully inferior to microfiber I
use for car care.  Intentionally did NOT use my fancy microfiber towels
for my 'test' (cleaned 2 tv's/2 phones/laptop/monitor/3 glasses) so the
'test' would be ONLY about how/if this KIT works.  Whereas these cloths
are far beyond the typical 'brushed blue paper' in most screen cleaning
sets, they are quite small, but nicely formulated to be ridged on 1 side
and more towel-like on the other.  Although I give just these cloths a
""Very Good"" score, will most likely complete further cleaning with my
nice microfiber towels...not only nicer quality and cleaning capability
(and of course, MUCH less abrasive) but big enough to be folded over.

Lastly, detaining any points on this set for the box would be unfair.
I've received dozens of similar weight/sized boxes without damage.

ends were crushed open, even with a 'lock tab') it's plenty sturdy now.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29BV1AX1SN0CM,TexasIndian,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on July 14, 2024",False,B0D4XZWYZ5,One person found this helpful,,,

626,RKF8J7MQ3C8SP,Too little safety info on what is in the bottles,"I see that this product gets almost entirely very high marks for being a product that effectively cleans screens. And how well a product does the job that it is designed to do is one of the top criteria I consider before deciding to purchase a product. But the most important criteria to me, is whether a product is safe or potentially harmful.
On the box, and on each bottle, it reads: ""Major constituent Surfactant, organic solvent, preservative, fragrance, etc.""
According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) website, ""Organic solvents can be carcinogens (cancer causing), reproductive hazards, and neurotoxins."" So, of course, I want to know whether the screen cleaner in the bottles are safe, or whether they might be harmful to use. Is the solvent used safe if it comes into contact with my skin or is inhaled? The fact that it has a ""fragrance"" implies that some fumes are anticipated to be inhaled.
When I typed my safety question on the product page, the AI generated response said, ""The screen cleaner is safe to use as it is non-toxic, alcohol-free and fragrance-free. It is also plant-based and environmentally friendly."" However, on the product label and on the box, it reads, ""...preservative, fragrance, etc."" Nowhere does it say fragrance-free. And, what are the preservatives and what is the etc?
Many products will list active ingredients, supplemental ingredients, and inert ingredients. This product does not list a single ingredient.
While the product does state that ""It is forbidden to eat,"" nowhere can I find what the active ingredients are and whether the product is safe to touch or smell. And nowhere does it say that this product is non-toxic. If accidentally ingested by a child, what do I tell the folks at the Poison Control Hotline?
This product may be perfectly safe, and maybe it is actually plant-based and environmentally friendly just as the AI description claims. But if this is the case, then why is this critical information not provided anywhere on the product or product page?
While the product does work well, and the microfiber cloth works well but could be bigger, I cannot give this product more than three stars as long as there is no information telling me just what sort of chemicals I may be exposing myself to when I use this product.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKF8J7MQ3C8SP,Steven Wills,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2024",False,B0D4XZWYZ5,One person found this helpful,,,

I can confirm the dependability and effectiveness of this printer since I have been using it for a number of weeks now. The print quality is great, with labels that are crisp and clear, which ensures that major carriers such as the United States Postal Service, United Parcel Service, and FedEx will accurately scan and track the packages.

635,R3953F8TO8KCA6,Efficient and Versatile Thermal Shipping Label Printer for Small Businesses,"As a small business owner heavily reliant on efficient shipping processes, I recently invested in the Mvgges thermal printer, and it has truly transformed my shipping operations. Compatible with a range of platforms including Mac, Windows, iOS, Android, and various e-commerce platforms like Amazon, eBay, Shopify, and Etsy, this printer offers unparalleled versatility.

Setup was a breeze - I was up and running within minutes on my laptop, thanks to the intuitive installation process and clear video instructions provided on a USB key. The compatibility with both Bluetooth and USB connectivity means I can effortlessly switch between devices depending on my needs, whether it's printing labels from my laptop computer or directly from my smartphone or tablet.

One of the standout features for me is the crisp and clear thermal printing quality. Each label comes out with precision and clarity, ensuring that important shipping information is always legible and professional. This has significantly reduced errors and improved the overall presentation of my packages, enhancing customer satisfaction.

The seamless integration with major shipping carriers like USPS and UPS streamlines the shipping process further. I can easily generate and print shipping labels directly from their respective platforms, saving me valuable time and effort.

Another aspect that sets this printer apart is its compact and sleek design, making it a perfect fit for my small office space, especially since there are no label feeding tray in the back of the printer, but everything is integrated inside it.

Overall, I couldn't be happier with my purchase of this label printer. It has streamlined my shipping processes, improved efficiency, and enhanced the professionalism of my business.

As a small business owner juggling multiple online platforms (Amazon, Etsy, you name it!), this printer has been a total game-changer. It's incredibly easy to set up and use – I had it running in minutes, even with my limited tech skills. The fact that it works seamlessly with both my MacBook and iPhone is a huge plus for my on-the-go lifestyle.

Printing 4x6 labels is a breeze, and the quality is crisp and professional. No more smudged ink or wasted labels! Plus, it's compatible with all the major shipping carriers, so I don't have to worry about formatting issues.

637,R20NQ53NQWZXUN,Narrow flexibility but functional.,"This is a decent thermal printer and the instructional videos noted on their manual are questionable considering the QR codes included takes you to a Google Drive. I watched a couple of the videos for simple setup and immediately deleted them from my drive, and chose to block the files to be safe. Either way, the only way you can use this is via bluetooth, or by hooking up the included printer cable to your computer which would require installing software (I'm assuming via the included flash drive) on your personal computer, and I'm not going to do that. I only want to print from my phone via Bluetooth, and have to do so with their app.

Most of it is pretty self-explanatory and easy to follow, but the integration and some commands are still in another language and I couldn't figure out how to change that setting. Either way, you're able to print via pdf, image, label, or via template. I couldn't get the template screen to show anything, and had more success with the image print than all other settings. The nice thing is, it has some flexibility for other labels, and you can change the sizes for those via the Label printing menu. Although, I don't have other thermal labels to test that out at the moment, but I'm glad that's a possibility as I often print labels for family events and other types of packaging.

The main loading options are pretty easy, you can run it through the back via a flat stack of labels. Otherwise, there is a roll holder inside, to be able to store your labels and not have to worry about fumbling with it behind the machine. This is the ultimate space saver, as the printer is a bit larger than expected. If space is an issue, I recommend using it via a roll is definitely more ideal. Also, if you decide to have a flat stack of labels that run from behind the printer, make sure it's at the right angle and distance to where it won't start peeling labels as it pulls through the feeder.

There are no gradations of color if you decide to print images, as you can see, you have to make sure there are solid lines and straight black and white contrast in order to be able to see the image. I did notice a line around the beginning of each of my prints where it may not have heated up enough, so I will troubleshoot that if it continues over time and becomes a bothersome issue.

REAL Product - They are real apple earbuds, durable and people are lying
Fit / Comfort - They will fit small ears amazingly and feel like nothing is there, big ears not so much
Sound - Low end and mid is great. Nothing special, high end slightly lacking but its barely noticable
Durability - Lasted me for 1.5 years so far, tough and will survive water (swimming, washing machine)
Damage - None. They were perfect and still are right out the box
Mic - Dont get for a mic. Its in the speakers themselves and are too quiet, but they are in 2 channels ig
Tangling - They do get tangled but they are easy to untangle
Overall - 9.5/10, get if you have small or average ears, they feel like nothing is in your ear

FULL DETAILED REVIEW:
Im writing this to discourage the negative reviews that I see way too much about these things. They are REAL apple made products. They did not come used, broken, or anything. I bought these as I wanted some actual good earbuds that would last. I have used the samsung ones for about 2 years when I broke them, so I tried apple. I found some laying around in school (ik its gross) washed em, and they worked great. Sound quality is actually very good for earbuds, however I havent used any super expensive headphones that would blow me away and make these sound terrible in comparison. The low end or ""bass"" is very important to me and thankfully it is pretty loud, nothing outstanding or anything though. The High end is kindof lacking but not much, still sounds great. Mid sound is loudest, not overwhelming though, pretty good. Anyway, I lost those, so I ordered them, on Amazon. They came early, unused, undamaged, and they sound great. No complaints and they have lasted me for nearly a year. Now an issue you might have with these buds if at all are 2 things: Fit and Comfort. These will not fit everybody's ears, escpecially big ones. However, they fit in mine perfectly and within a minute I forget I even have anything in my ear, but thats just me. 2 is comfort, which some people have issues with. I think these are incredibly comfortable with the non-silicon tips. They dont hurt, but maybe thats just me. I hate the silicon tips, but some people dont. Either way, you can get used to them. Other things to mention; you can drown these in water or leave them in the wash accidentally and they will work fine. As long as their not in deep water for like over an hour, they should still work. also, Tangling is not a big problem with these. They definetly do get tangled, but they are very easy to ungtangle unlike other buds. Lastly, Microphone. I would not recomment these if you need them to have a good mic. I was surprised to test these and find out the Volume controller that has a mic label on it isnt actually a mic, the phones themselves are. And they are weird. They are wayyyyy too quiet and each but has its own channel, so you can talk into say the left bud and whoever is recieving your mic signal will hear only out the left headphone. You also have to have it so close to your mouth that you are pretty much making out with it. Besides that, they are amazing. Some people with love them, others will hate. If you have small ears, I recomment these. They come in a nice little box too. They will feel like nothing is there. 9.5/10 earbuds in my opinion. Best earbuds I have ever used.

The sound quality is surprisingly good for earbuds of this size, delivering clear and crisp audio across a range of genres. They're comfortable to wear for extended periods, thanks to their ergonomic design.

My only minor gripe is that the 3.5mm plug feels a bit small, making it slightly challenging to grasp when plugging it into devices.

653,RDG8P6E8Q2ISX,"Simple, Reliable, and Still Rocking","Design & Comfort: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Let's start with the design. Classic Apple – sleek, white, and instantly recognizable. The EarPods are the Frank Sinatra of earbuds, timeless and effortlessly cool. The fit is surprisingly snug, and they won't be doing acrobatics in your ears if you decide to break into an impromptu dance.

Audio Quality: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

While they won't make you feel like you're front row at a concert, the audio quality is commendable for the price. Crisp highs, decent mids, and enough bass to keep your head nodding. Whether you're jamming to Taylor Swift or getting lost in a podcast, the EarPods handle it with finesse.

Built-in Remote: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

The built-in remote is a game-changer. Need to skip that Taylor Swift ballad because it's hitting too close to home? Just a click away. Got an incoming call from your boss during your power walk? Answer it without breaking your stride. The remote is a small but mighty feature that puts control at your fingertips.

Compatibility with USB-C: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

The move to USB-C is a welcomed upgrade. No more flipping the connector three times to get it right – it's the little things, right? Plus, it plays well with newer devices, keeping you in sync with the times.

Durability: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

For a pair of wired earbuds, they're surprisingly durable. I've accidentally tossed them in my bag with keys and survived without a scratch. The cable isn't the type to unravel into a spaghetti mess after one too many rounds in your pocket, and that's a win in my book.

Price: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Let's talk about the elephant in the room – the price. These EarPods won't break the bank, and considering the brand and the performance, they're a steal. Apple delivers the quality you expect without gouging your wallet.

Conclusion:

In a world filled with flashy competitors, the Apple EarPods with USB-C are a reliable, no-nonsense option. They won't make you the envy of the audiophile community, but they'll get the job done – and they'll do it well. Whether you're a casual listener or someone who just wants a solid pair of earbuds that won't let you down, these EarPods are a solid choice. Simple, reliable, and still rocking – just like your favorite classic tune.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDG8P6E8Q2ISX,Fendi Ferreira,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/8b6a8673-74a4-47e0-951d-b44ad7aebd92._CR0,0,500,500_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2024",True,B0CHXC5ZDX,108 people found this helpful,,,

657,R1588QMIT98U7P,Excellent value,"I was a long holdout, sticking to my wired earbuds for the longest time. Then I upgraded to a phone without a headphone jack and decided it was time to get Bluetooth headphones. I bought this item because they came in different colors besides black and white and they were a relatively low price point.  I got them in the bright blue color.
I love the way they look.

They do not disappoint! They connect quickly and have surprisingly great sound!  They are not noise reducing, however the earpieces fit so well in my ears that it makes it hard to hear people or noises around me unless my volume is down very low or I take one earbud out of my ear.

I really like the charging indicator on the front. They charge using a USB-C cord (included) OR by placing the case on a Qi charger.  The cord charges them way faster,  but I like having the flexibility of both means.
I liked these so much I got another set in a different color for my teenage son. I figured if he broke or lost them, they're not a significant cost to replace. (Also the reason I trusted myself with them.)
Of course it would be ME who left the earbuds in a pocket of shorts that I then put through the washing machine.  Oops. BUT I put them immediately into a bag of rice to draw out the moisture. Impatiently,  I took them out two hours later to charge and try again.  They worked! The sound was muffled at first but now that it has been a few days since the sound is back to normal.
I do NOT recommend washing them, nor wearing them in water, but they made it though one accidental washing.
I am super impressed that these things held up so well to my carelessness, and have great sound and functionality.

658,R31Y2KCBASOXLW,Great value for both phone calls and music,"Sometimes I'm amazed by the advancements in wireless and micro technology, especially when it comes to audio. These popped up in an email from Amazon a few days ago. Though I usually ignore those Deal notices this one intrigued me. I have a JBL Everest over-ear headset that I love for indoor phone calls and they're pretty good for music too (though I don't use them that way). I often like to go outside when I'm on the phone and the JBLs aren't convenient to use with a stocking cap, so I'd thought briefly about getting something in-ear to wear under my hat. These were $35 and the reviews were good. I liked that the case wirelessly charges the ear buds, and the case can be charged wirelessly too. My Samsung phone has wireless charging so I already have two wireless chargers and they're very convenient (especially given that the USB port on my phone was getting sketchy). So I figured I'd give them a try. I played a variety of my favorite music. I first asked for Jeff Buckley live music and the first song that started playing as I stepped outside was ""Hallelujah."" I walked around the property listening to my favorite music and before I knew it I had been listening to music for about three hours. I had really only cared about the sound quality for phone calls and whether they would stay in my ears (which is usually a problem for me). They never came close to falling out and they are comfortable. For phone calls the sound quality is very good on both ends. And though they're rated as having a 33' range I walked all around the house and got considerably farther than that from my phone with two walls separating the devices and I had no dropouts. Overall I am so happy with them that after a week of using them I ordered a backup pair.

I have three VERY minor niggles but even combined I wouldn't consider them significant enough to knock off even ½ star. First, I had trouble gripping them well enough to get them out of the case quickly when I got an unexpected phone call. I started leaving them on a paper towel on the table next to me, but it now seems I've discovered the right way to grip them. Second, though they have a voice announcement of which side is which when first removed from the case, I was concerned that I might confuse L and R as they don't appear to have any visible indicators. My solution was to use my fine-point permanent marker to write an L on the left one. Third, one of my wireless phone chargers is a tilted stand that holds my phone at a convenient angle. I was unable to get the Ear buds case to wirelessly charge on that one until last night when I accidentally discovered that the problem was that the case was too small to hit the sweet spot on the charger. I solved the problem by boosting the case up with a pad of mini sticky notes (as shown in the photo).

EDIT (I apologize if I forget to come back to delete my previous review):

None of the above has changed but I forgot to mention that these are NOT good for noise isolation (at least not the way they fit me) but I prefer it that way. I'm a musician and music sounds less natural to me when the surrounding environment is completely eliminated, and I like being able to have a conversation or hear a knock at the door without removing them. Even without a tight seal I never have to reseat them and the sound quality stays consistent (a first for me after trying several other brands).

UPDATE: I've been using these ear buds for five weeks now. I use them for hours every day and they continue to impress me. On three occasions only the right channel had a signal when I initially put them in to listen to music, but each time I put them back in the case and took them out again (which turned them off and on) and they worked normally. I've only had this happen with music and only when I first take them out of the case (i.e. it hasn't happened while on a call or after I've been listening to music with both working).",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31Y2KCBASOXLW,thirst4music,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61fvUKyPotL._SY88.jpg'],,"Reviewed in the United States on February 14, 2023",True,B09DT48V16,874 people found this helpful,,,

661,R1IUP603OUQGE9,Amazing buds/price/service... buy these!,"Yes, my subject line sounds like that trash hyperbole you get on annoying pop-up ads on your Smartphone! And ironically, it usually has to do with ear buds. There are tons of them on the market, and everyone claims to be the best.

Now, first off, I am just a customer… never got any gifts or money or anything from this company, nor was asked to “click on a review” for a discount or whatever. No… the reason for all this hallelujah chorus, is that I’m really totally both jazzed, and a bit in awe of these earbuds. I think the main mind-blowing thing about them is the price. I mean, I have a bit of experience and knowledge with this kind of technology, and frankly, these days, what “guts” that are needed to be used to create Bluetooth ear buds is not that complex… nor expensive. How company’s like Sony, Apple, Bose, etc. can charge upwards of $300 for these boarders on theft and fraud!

I’ve tried those “Rolls Royce” buds, and I urge you to do the same, and then try these Tagry Bluetooth Wireless Earbuds that are literally 90% less expensive. Yes, they retail for about $35! They come in an excellent quality charge base, are extremely easy to put on, (and have three extra size buds to give you a custom fit), and most important, their sound quality, and I mean crisp highs, solid middles, and bone- rumbling base, are outstanding. I cannot understand what more you would want either using them for talk radio, podcasts, YouTube, streaming movies, or TV, or playing your Amazon Music or Spotify or iTunes playlists. And yes, if connected to your iPhone, you can make and receive calls, and the microphone in the buds are top quality.

Their Bluetooth software is flawless, connecting to your iPhone, or other Bluetooth devices effortlessly. They come with a pleasant woman’s voice letting you know various messages, like which earbud is in what ear, if they are connected or turned off, your volume control (including excess volume warning), etc.
I’ve had these for several months, and have found the charging, which has a bright LED display and shows the individual charging of each bud, along with their percentage easy to read.

And a note on their service. I’ve heard horror stories of folks trying to reach the outrageously over-priced other earbud company’s for tech support, or refunds, exchanges, etc. Basically it’s nonexistent, and when you do miraculously find a phone number to call them, and get someone on the line, you have to go to the UN to find an interpreter of rare third-world languages to understand what they are saying, and they seem to be trained, not on anything to do with the product, but to make the call as useless and confusing as possible, so that you will just give up and throw their buds, and your money in the trash.

Now, I did have an initial problem, after a few months, in that the base charger seemed to be slowing a bit. Tagry gives you a LIFETIME WARRANTY… yes, an actually lifetime warranty, not one of those sham “lifetime warranties”, that corrupt company’s like Hammacher Schlemmer  have.

I had enrolled with Tagry, on their website, to activate my warranty as soon as I received the buds. I called Tagry when I was seeing what could be a glitch in their charging base, and yes, unlike most other companies who hide their contact numbers as if they were nuclear codes, Tagry’s support phone number is plainly printed on their manual, and to my astonishment, I immediately was connected to a good ‘ol American customer service person, who actually worked for the company, spoke English, and made me feel as if I was a long-ago trusted friend. They truly cared, and said they were sorry, and that there was no need to troubleshoot the base, or return it, instead, they would process an order to send me a new one.

A day later, they actually called me back to let me know that the replacement had been shipped, and that I should have it in a day or so, and if not, to please call them back right away. And yes, to apologize again for any inconvenience.  The replacement arrived the very next day. And again, their warranty is indeed for a lifetime, a no questions asked replacement policy. This is how much they believe in their product, and respect their customers.

So, yes. It is insane to pay more than $35 for quality Bluetooth earbuds. Last year, I sent about a dozen of these out to friends and employees, to use for personal use, and for all that Zooming going on… and they love them. And none of had any problems.

I’m sure you have had a plethora of bad experiences in the past few years, what with isolation, and way too much ordering on-line, finding the products you buy to be substandard, and customer service virtually non-existent. And that is why I’ve spend all this time expounding on the greatest of my earbuds. Yes, I have a life. Really. But what a joy to be able to tell a story like this, rather than the kind of frustration most of us are experiencing every day!

665,R2ZDNIMKUQXTMZ,Spent the night at the bottom of a p-trap and still works,"So yeah. I don't normally write reviews, but after night I put my earbud through, it definitely deserves it. I was listening to Harry potter for the 1067th time with it while brushing my teeth. We live in a super run down house, so the sink drain doesn't have a stopper. And what happens? Of course, it's what I've imagined happening every single time I lean over that sink. (No, not pennywise speaking to me through the drains, although I have had that thought too.) My left earbud popped out of my ear and went straight down the drain.

There was water down the pipe (which I guess is supposed to be there all the time. Who knew.) So I tried fishing it out with a coat hanger. That didn't work. Then I watched three youtube videos about how to remove the p-trap (that's that one pipe that is kinda u shaped under your sinks) because I was just hoping beyond hope that it would still be there. But you see, I already struggle opening a jar of pickles, so yeah there was very little hope for me to unscrew that p-trap.

Now, this was at 11pm and my man was already asleep. So i wrote a quick and desperate plea along with a declaration of love and a few bribes for him to see once he woke up in the morning. At that point I did not think it would work. I just didn't want it blocking the pipes and breaking my already broken house.

But what do I awaken to? My man presenting me with an earbud. I returned it to the charger, probably out of habit more than anything and saw that it was charging. Weird.

703,R1Y5ERMF8QZ7X4,Puts charge into my S8 quickly,"I bought this a few months ago as 'emergency backup', if I happened to be away from a charging source (so, not in a building or car; generally for camping and the like).  The battery in my Galaxy S8 has degraded over time, and I wasn't ready to get spendy on a new phone, nor did I look forward to 'cell phone surgery' to replace the battery (the days of popping off the case back and swapping out in a minute or two are long gone, sad to say).  So I ordered this up.  At 10,000 mAh, I figured I should get enough charge to get me through a jam.

If you're thinking... ""S8!  That's a dinosaur!""  -- you're likely rocking something much more current, and aren't worried about off-grid power.  Yet.  But remember -- all batteries degrade with time.

After having used it... my thoughts
- Takes a bit to charge up, once discharged (so once you've discharged, plan ahead).  Especially the first time.

- However, once it's charged up, the self-discharge rate is slow, so you don't have to constantly keep it plugged into a wall wart, etc.  You can charge this up, once conditioned, and pack it away for a few weeks to a few months.

- The 4 LED meters on the front are handy for determining SoC / Time to Charge

- Form factor on this is very similar to the dimensions on my S8 (although a little thicker, and of course, heavier)

- A shorter USB A &lt;> USB-C cable does double duty -- USB A to bring the charge to the phone / device via USB-C, then remove & flip USB-C into the input of the Anker, while plugging the 'A' end into any compatible port to recharge it.

- Comes with a black cloth bag with drawstring closure, which is nice to keep that short USB cable together with the device.  Nothing fancy, but useful.

- And probably the best, after using Qi-Wireless for 90% of the time over the life of the G8 -- this thing puts juice into the phone, quickly.  I can go from 5-15% charge to 30% in under 30min.  Not sure how many amps it's charging at (rated at 'up to 12' -?), but it's definitely quick.  If you're caught somewhere without power (or even if you're not) -- this device is a lifesaver (figuratively & perhaps literally, I guess).

Technically, I guess you're not supposed to use the phone while charging with a power bank, but it comes in handy for those times where you need to use the phone a little longer, but need a little juice to tide you over (it juices the phone so fast--especially vs. Qi-wireless--that you say ""I might as well just keep it hooked up to this)).  I think it'll charge close to 100% in about 90 minutes, maybe less.

- Since my G8 battery is ~ 3800 mAh (?), I can get up to two full charges out of this thing, or many 'partial' charges.  From full, 30 minutes' time on the G8 doesn't even remove one 'dot' from the 4-light meter.  This is real value, in my book.  Because most of the time, I can get back to a power source in 30min or so.

So... for what I'm using it for, which is to buy time until I decide to finally (!) upgrade my phone, and keep the S8 running a little while longer... it's an excellent accessory, from a trusted company.  Since this has been out a while, and been superseded by higher-cap devices, solar-capable chargers, etc. -- it's also cheap -- about the cost of one of those replacement battery kits (with batteries that came from who knows where).

Not often I unequivocally give the full 5-stars... but this product gets them from me.  Recommended.

It does a great job for its intended use. As all Anker products are known to do.  I ordered this for a family trip to Disney Land, thinking my phone wouldn’t last a full day at the park and I was right. It recharged my phone fully and still had over half charge. Without needing it for more than one recharge per day, I would guess it would easily provide three full recharges, maybe four. The bigger issue was having it delivered to the Anaheim Hilton, who released it to the onsite fedex kinkos, who then charged me a fee per pound to release my delivery to me. This particular item not weighing much, was not a big cost, but I also had two multipacks of celsius energy drinks delivered. In all, for the three items, fedex kinkos charged me over 22 dollars to release all three items. Being made aware of this before hand would have been really nice to know from Amazon.

This Anker PowerBank was Introduced on Amazon in 2019. I consider this a Basic Power Bank, the standout features are that it functions as expected based on its designed and engineered capabilities.
One would and should expect expert performance in both design, fit and function as well as performance with the use of quality parts from Anker. I consider this capacity of PowerBank to be a Hearty Workhorse in my or any stable of devices requiring power.
Performance must be assured, trusted.

- I can not rate battery life as I have placed it into use thus far in a limited way with bluetooth speakers, External USB A light &c.
- C and Micro USB inputs are fairly standard issue for this range (10,000 mAh) of PowerBank, as are the USB A output to charge or power your device using your supplied correct cable.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R32YYJP9RK8OI2,Publius Publico,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/4d1314df-d47b-4ee9-8824-e20a2bfcfb8b._CR0,29.0,275,275_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on June 2, 2024",True,B07QXV6N1B,,,,
712,RL5NGMHP61ATU,"Love Anker, but the battery is already swellling","Bought a refurbished one and it came with strange streaks on it (see photos). Not a huge deal as it's just a cosmetic issue, but they didn't come off even when wiping with isopropyl alcohol. Still not sure what they are a year later.

At any rate, it worked beautifully for the trip I needed it for and once or twice on the odd road trip since, but in the past month or so I've noticed it starting to swell very slightly. It isn't enough that it's very noticeable, but to the touch there is a slight puff. Given it's just over a year, I find that worrying.

Will be looking for a battery pack that charges over USB-C next time, since this one only charges over micro USB and it's one of the few devices left that I own that does.

713,RDZ0JT5O6K1QB,"Perfect & Easy to apply, even if your not very steady","I've been meaning to get a screen protector for my Galaxy 5 Watch that I received for Christmas & any time I looked in stores, they were out. So, I finally checked Amazon & came across these.
  I love that they have different colors & an easy to apply screen protector. But I especially love the Bumpers!! I never realized there was such a thing & any time I cross my arms, I end up hitting the buttons on my watch & changing things without meaning to & after a while it gets super annoying!
  So, while I just needed a screen protector, I also found I needed a bumper too! No more changed screens or even watch faces without meaning to, because now the buttons can't easily be pushed, especially by accident.
  In the photo I have the Clear bumper on & love it, but also love that there is a couple different pink too, because that is the color watch I wanted, but it's also nice to have black & silver if I ever want to change it up or match something I'm wearing a little better because pink doesn't always match my outfits.... And it's easy enough to change out!
  I do have 2 teeny air bubbles that keep reappearing, but it was my first time installing a screen protector, so if or when I need to change it out, hopefully I'll get a little better at it & not have that happen or maybe after awhile of doing the  squeegie move, lol, they will cease to return! Either way, they are super tiny so I'm not too worried about it and if they get bigger I can always change it out (I do have 4 more!) or even have my phone guy install it because he has far more practice and is way better at it than I.

716,R19OWH38GTDL03,A Screen and Overall Watch Protector of Such High Quality That It Looks Like it Was Made by Samsung,"I am currently sporting the Samsung Watch6 40mm, which is a beautiful daily companion, and I am very accident prone, so I knew I had to choose a very high quality and robust screen protect and bezel protector in order to perfectly preserve this watch's beauty for many years to come. I came across this KIMILAR 5 pack, which had bezel protectors in 5 different colors, along with 5 screen protectors, and this appealed to me greatly because I wanted a black colored bezel protector to match my watch and I really liked having the comfort of having 5 screen protectors because that meant I had 5 chances to install it correctly and perfectly (as I am also not the best screen protector installer).  I have been using the screen protector and bezel protector for over a month now and I can say with certainty that this is the best possible protector you can get for your Samsung watch, if you are searching through other similar products right now, please close your other tabs, because this is the best protector you can buy on Amazon, hands down, no doubts or questions about it. You can save yourself time and add this fantastic package to your cart right now and know that you are getting a quality product that will not let you down or disappoint you, but if you want to know more details about why this combo product is absolutely amazing, please read on!

I will tell you honestly that installing the screen protector itself was very easy and straightforward. What was not easy was ensuring that I did not get any dust trapped between the watch screen and the screen protector, this happened on my first try and was completely my fault. Which is why I was so happy that I had 4 more chances to get this right!! Thankfully on my second attempt, I was able to successfully center the screen protector and it adhered to the watch face quickly and perfectly. The screen protector does not impede the sensitivity or usability of the screen at all, it does not negatively impact the clarity of the screen itself (it still looks crystal clear), and the screen protector is very easy to clean when it gathers fingerprints and water droplets. The screen protector is of phenomenal quality, as I have exposed it from everything to rain and fingerprints to heavy hits against tabletops, and this screen protector has held up like a champion, and more importantly it has flawlessly protected my watch face with no signs of damage whatsoever.

Soon after I placed the screen protector upon my watch, I installed the black bezel protector and this device installed seamlessly on the Watch6 40mm, it fits snug like a glove, and as you can see in my pictures, the quality, color, and fitting of this bezel protector is so top notch that it looks like an OEM product that came preinstalled on the watch!! This bezel protector has been a boon for me as it has successfully protected my watch faithfully over the past month without any scratches, chips, or dents to the watch itself or the bezel protector through quite a few accidental wall thuds and table bumps.

Overall, I cannot praise this combo product offered by KIMILAR enough, it has protected my watch flawlessly and I know that it will continue to do so for many years to come. So, if you are looking for a quality protector for your new Samsung Watch, look no further, you have found it right here.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19OWH38GTDL03,Cory C.,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71OXAk-6ohL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71x-hA4YNLL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81bK1WT1MwL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81w6vSt7+6L._SY88.jpg']",,"Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2023",True,B0CBX6HNXR,23 people found this helpful,,,

719,R255WIIG90XZMA,Sturdier than it initially looks!,"At first glance when you receive these items you may think ""Hmm, these don't look very sturdy."" I know I did. But looks are deceiving.  This is my second purchase of a set of these protectors. I have several different color watchbands and wanted some variety in the screen protector colors as well so purchased this set which has different colors than the first set I ordered. So more were ordered to give me more color options.

I'm not always the most graceful person and have been known, in the course of doing normal every day things, to accidently smack my arm/hand/wrist against doorways, walls or whatnot. So having something to protect my watch face is a necessity for me.  A few months ago I was doing some yardwork and ended up with a hard knock up against a wooden shelf out in our garden shed as I was trying to keep some flowerpots from falling over the edge. It was a hard enough smack that I initially thought I may have broken my watch.

No one was more surprised than I when I looked down to check the watch and it was fine and working as usual. The protector that had been on it DID crack and actually fall off. But before its demise it did its job and valiantly protected the watch face from the impact. In essence, it gave its life to protect its ""client.""  Can't ask for more than that.

720,R2KVZ0CVTOB3J5,"Hard to install, difficult pressing button on side of watch.","I so much wanted to like these, but alas, it was not to be. I really dislike how the Galaxy watch 6 looks. I had the S3 Frontier before, and loved the rotating bezel. The Galaxy 6 has no bezel at all, and just looks incomplete and small. I was hoping these cases would help ""bulk"" the watch face out and make it look more complete.

While it looks simple to install these, the actuality is a bit different. You have to carefully line up the holes for the watch buttons (and it keeps slipping off), then try to snap down the other side. Unfortunately, it catches on the edge of the watch and doesn't want to snap in place. You need to pull out the bottom edge to help clear the watch face. Meanwhile, you're doing all this while desperately trying not to touch the watch face, as the instructions already had you clean it thoroughly! You basically need 3 hands to get it done.

Once on, the watch looks much better. I was hoping to switch between black and silver (to go with a silver watch band), but the ""silver"" color is very muted, and not shiny like metal. It's more grey then silver. I'm not quite sure why they tell you to clean, install the case, then install the screen protector. Once the case is in place, it makes it harder to see where to place the screen protector. Plus, if the screen protector was already on before the case, you would have less problems getting the case on as you could touch the face of the watch. In the future when switching cases/screen protectors, I will clean/install screen protector/install case, in that order. Lastly, there were bubbles I could not squeeze out of the sides when installing the screen protector. Decided to leave it and see if I could live with it, but 24 hours later, the bubbles were gone. Touch sensitivity is degraded slightly, but still usable.

The largest negative is that with the case in place, it's VERY difficult to push the buttons on the side of the watch. You almost have to use a fingernail to get in there to depress the button. I'm an adult male, so maybe if you have smaller fingers it will work better, but I doubt it. This issue alone would justify my rating. If I knew then what I know now, I would order something different.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2KVZ0CVTOB3J5,D,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on December 5, 2023",True,B0CBX6HNXR,,,,

This is helpful as I'm often listening to music on the move. It's very nice when I'm exercising as I don't need to worry about my earbuds coming off. Second, these earbuds have great sound. I can hear the high notes and the low notes. It comes through crystal clear. Third, these earbuds have a very long charge. This is so helpful as I don't need to recharge them for a long period of time. And when they new to recharge, I can just throw them on my phone charging pad. The case acts as a charger. Not only do the earbuds have a long charge, but they can recharge in the case. I appreciate the charging gauge on the case. This provides quick access to see the level of charge that is present. Then I always know when a recharge may be warranted. The cost is incredible for the functionality and sound of these earbuds. They are just as good with extra added features compared to other expensive brands. I am not sure why someone would pay so much money for other earbuds that don't have all the fesutes that these have. Why pay more for something that is less? I've purchased from this company before. Fortunately, I have not had to use the warranty, but the company has been very responsive in the activation of the promised warranty. I am very happy with the purchase of the earbuds. The shipping time was super fast. It came with its own charging cable. It also has different sized comfortable ear buds to fit different ears. The earbuds also have touch control adjustments which are very convenient. So when I'm on the move I can answer phone calls or skip tracks without having to pull out my phone. The earbuds also easily connect to your device. Just have to pull them out and they easily connected to my phone. Super duper easy. I would definitely purchase this product again!

756,R2394N85A45S4U,Tensea Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Screen Protector Case: Elevating Protection and Style,"I am absolutely thrilled with my purchase of the Tensea Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Screen Protector Case, and I can confidently award it a well-deserved 5 stars. This accessory set has not only met but exceeded my expectations in terms of functionality, design, and overall user experience.

One of the standout features of this product is the ""High Responsive Touch"" technology. The hard PC bumper and HD anti-fog tempered glass protective film have effectively addressed my touch troubles. The screen remains highly responsive even in wet conditions, eliminating the need to constantly remove and wipe the screen after activities like showering, exercising, or being caught in the rain. The smooth touch of the 9H tempered glass adds to the overall bright visual experience, making interactions with my Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 seamless and enjoyable.

The inclusion of 5 packs of tempered glass screen protectors and 5 packs of PC protective bumper cases in the multipack is a game-changer. This comprehensive set provides complete protection for my Samsung Galaxy Watch 6, shielding it from unexpected shocks or shatters. The simple and generous design also complements various watch bands, allowing for versatile styling options.

The emphasis on ""Screen Protection"" is evident in the design of the PC bumper, effectively guarding against dust, dirt, scratches, and other potential damages. The precise cutout design ensures a snug fit, granting access to all controls, buttons, and sensors with utmost precision.

Installation has never been easier. The Tensea Samsung Watch 6 cases and screen protectors are a breeze to install and remove, eliminating the hassle of taking off the watch bands. This user-friendly feature adds to the overall convenience of owning and maintaining the protective set.

In conclusion, the Tensea Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 Screen Protector Case has proven to be a reliable and stylish companion for my smartwatch. It not only offers top-tier protection but also enhances the overall user experience. If you're looking for a high-quality and multipurpose accessory set for your Samsung Galaxy Watch 6, I wholeheartedly recommend the Tensea screen protector case for its innovation, durability, and ease of use.

757,R83W72UAQ2MS7,I like the case but the screen protector doesn't stick well,"The case snaps on nice and tight, I really like that the rim of the case is slightly higher than the watch screen which offers better protection. The matte black case doesn't perfectly match the watch band but it's close enough.

The screen protector is not perfect but it's nice. As others have said, it's a tiny bit smaller than the watch screen. It's not a big deal though because what are the chances that your watch screen will get scratched in the tiny gap, it's less than a millimeter.

When I applied the screen protector, I noticed a small sliver around the edge of the bottom section didn't adhere, I pressed really hard but the air bubble wouldn't go away. The next day, the air bubble grew to what you see in my pic. I can press on it but the bubble won't go away. I'm guessing it's going to fall completely off sometime soon, then I'll apply another one, hopefully it'll be better.

Edit: a few days after I wrote this review, I got tired of the large bubble under the screen protector, so I decided I would replace it with one of the extras. Since I was planning on throwing away the screen protector, I figured I might as well try just rotating it to see what happens. So I rotated it 180 degrees and stuck it back on. Well, the huge air bubble disappeared, there were only a couple tiny slivers of air around the edge so I left it on to see what would happen. Now it's July 11th and it's still stuck on and only has tiny slivers of air around the edges.

It's crystal clear and doesn't even look like it's on there. Very nice to have extras cuz it will get scratched and it'll be nice to replace it when need be.

The plastic case or protector cover, it is very cheap feeling but after you put it on the watch it feels good and I like that it keeps the buttons from sticking out so much. I didn't have a problem bumping the buttons but I don't have a problem using them with the case on either. They're cheap but they look decent.

Could you center it over the watch face? Sure, but then the crystal will likely just get chipped and dinged all around the edge.

760,R3IDBHQKSOQQGL,Good Protection For A Good Price,"UPDATE: Today is September 10th 2023 and I noticed that my black watch case was cracked (I'm not sure how or when it happened) but my watch is fine which is what really matters. The case did its job and I'm glad I had it on my watch. I uploaded two pictures, one showing the crack or I guess it's a split, and the other picture showing I'm now using the silver watch case because I think it looks nice with the black official Samsung fabric watch band.

I received this product on August 1st and I liked the looks of the contents but seeing as I was waiting for my preordered Galaxy Watch 6 Classic LTE 47mm in black from my carrier I had to put this product off to the side. On August 7th UPS delivered my Galaxy Watch 6 Classic LTE 47mm and after getting the watch setup and connected to my (preordered) Galaxy S23 Ultra 512gb I immediately opened up the package containing the watch cases and grabbed a black one along with one screen protector and the included suction cup.

Screen protector installation: I used a ZEISS glasses cleaner lens wipe that I have to wipe my watch screen clean. Once it was dry (took a few seconds) I inspected the watch face for any dust or lint particles, since I didn't see any I proceeded to getting the screen protector ready to install. I removed the screen protector from the soft white case and grabbed the suction cup and made sure to stick the suction cup on the opposite side of the pull tab that you remove first so you can apply the screen protector to the watch face. I checked again for any dust before I attempted to line up and apply the screen protector. Once I applied the screen protector I pressed down gently for a few seconds and I had to gently use my fingernail to get the suction cup off the screen protector. Once the suction cup was removed I put it back in the box and I noticed a almost have the screen bubble near the top so I gently used my fingernail to lift the edge (at 12 o'clock) and the whole screen protector almost came off so I pressed gently again and had a small bubble that I was able to remove by pressing gently in the middle and sliding my finger outward. I was concerned the adhesive wasn't going to stick but so far the screen protector has stayed in place.

Case Installation: The case was easy to install. I started with the button side and once that was seated properly I started pressing on the left side of the case and I heard a nice little click letting me know the case was properly installed. I looked it over to confirm it was installed correctly and I put my new watch on my wrist.

The case and screen protector seem of good quality and if either gets scraped up there is more than one in the package so it's worth the investment to keep your watch looking new.

I've included two pictures, the first picture  shows how the cases protects the bezel and leaves a little of the bezel exposed so you can rotate it. It's worth noting that rotating the bezel isn't as easy with the case on so you may need an additional bezel ring. I don't mind because after installing my case (different brand) on my GW3 LTE 45mm I got used to using the buttons and swiping the screen.

The second picture shows how the case protects the physical buttons but it doesn't make the buttons harder to press as the case just makes the buttons sit flush  against the case. I'm glad that the case protects the buttons like that because it also protects against an accidental button presses.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3IDBHQKSOQQGL,SupaDad,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/6e79b7c9-0687-4c1a-9242-df10604fffae._CR62,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/610bfdqONbL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/612qISJWBaL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61EnaNnnf0L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71OXk-r6HUL._SY88.jpg']",,"Reviewed in the United States on August 9, 2023",True,B0CB5JW9FS,22 people found this helpful,,,

773,R3NPC2ZKNYK84V,Exceptional Durability and Performance – A Must-Have for Apple Users!,"As an experienced reviewer with a vast background in evaluating tech products, I'm thoroughly impressed with this USB C to Lightning Cable set. Having rigorously tested it with various Apple devices, including the iPhone 14 Pro Max, 13 Pro, 12 mini, 11, X, XS, XR, 8 Plus, and various iPad models, I can confidently say that it stands out in the market for several reasons.

Firstly, the Apple MFi Certification is crucial. This certification ensures that the cable is built to Apple's exacting standards, offering not just compatibility but also the assurance of safety and optimal charging performance. It's a key factor that distinguishes this cable from numerous uncertified options flooding the market.

The 10ft length of each cable in this 2Pack set offers exceptional convenience. Whether you're using your device in bed, at your desk, or even in a larger space where an outlet isn't nearby, this length provides ample flexibility without compromising charging speed or efficiency.

Speaking of speed, these cables support fast charging. When used with a compatible USB-C Power Delivery charger, they significantly reduce the time required to charge your devices. This feature is particularly beneficial for power users or in situations where time is of the essence.

Durability is another standout aspect. The cables are robust and designed to withstand the rigors of daily use. The stress points near the connectors are well-reinforced, reducing the risk of fraying or damage that often plagues lesser-quality cables.

Lastly, the type C port support is a forward-thinking feature, aligning well with the latest trends in technology and ensuring compatibility with a wide range of current and future devices.

In conclusion, this 2Pack of USB C to Lightning Cables is a top-tier choice for any Apple user. It combines length, durability, fast charging capability, and MFi certification into an affordable package, making it an essential accessory for your Apple devices. Highly recommended for its superior quality and reliability.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3NPC2ZKNYK84V,Dan,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on November 29, 2023",True,B0BG7XSL4X,2 people found this helpful,,,

783,R3V3N1UDHLQ6CX,One of the Few Controllers That's Worth the Price,"The 8Bitdo Ultimate C 2.4g Wireless Controller with Turbo Function and Rumble Vibration is a game-changer that is a testament to style and functionality.  It has upped my gaming experience with its exceptional build qua--  Oh, wait a moment.  Sorry, I forgot I wasn't an AI.  Allow me to try again.  *ahem*

For any game controller, there are five aspects that matter most: comfort, connectivity, battery life, durability and responsiveness.  To sum up for those who want a quick review, this controller scored very high in each category.  I absolutely recommend it.  However, for those that wish for more details, they are offered below.

Comfort (9/10) -- It is very comfortable to hold.  Of the many controllers that I've held in my life, this one is comparably much more comfortable than most.  The only reason that I didn't offer the highest score is because I'm certain there are people out there who will find it either too small or too big.  To be fair, I'm not certain that there are any controllers that can universally offer proper comfort to every single person.

Connectivity (9/10) -- The controller connected immediately and without any issue.  Furthermore, it stayed connected no matter where I walked around in the room.  When I wished to disconnect or turn off the controller, it was extremely easy to do so.  The only thing I didn't like was that each controller requires its own dongle to connect.  It's a bit of an inconvenience.  I like the idea of connecting many controllers to the same system without issue, but perhaps that's just wishful thinking for now.

Battery Life (10/10) -- This is perhaps the most surprising feature of the controller, as it seems to last for an unusually long time.  In fact, I haven't ever had the battery run out.  I do charge it every once in a while, but not obsessively so.  I expected it to fail at some point and it hasn't yet.

Durability (9/10) -- While the controller is plastic, it feels quite durable.  It lacks that flimsy quality that many wireless controllers seem to have (as if dropping it the wrong way would break or chip something off).  I don't think it's deserving of a perfect 10 score because I don't think it would necessarily survive being thrown multiple times across the room by angry gamers (though whether or not that actually matters is up to you).

Responsiveness (10/10) -- I used the controller with multiple games with the explicit purpose of testing its responsiveness and was both surprised and pleased.  Every movement and button press happened instantaneously and they seemed to be the same whether the controller was plugged in or wireless.

Value (9/10) -- I have added value as an additional category for those who are wondering if the controller is actually worth the price.  After all, even if a controller is amazing, if it costs $1,000 -- is it really worth it?  In this case, it's definitely worth it.  It seems to sit around $30, which is more than fair given its competition.  It's simply not worth paying a few dollars less for something significantly worse.  This controller is worth the price that's being asked.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3V3N1UDHLQ6CX,J.

784,R267VEMQX4ZG17,The Bunnii's Verdict is In! YES GIMME MORE.,"Okay so let's jump into this review. I am a Semi truck driver, so my stuff needs to be able to take a beating lol. I have a laptop and like to play FPS games when I'm in my down time. We'll go over some pros and some cons and then I'll give my personal taste.

Pros:
- Lightweight, but not cheap o.o
- great connectivity
- the design fits comfortably in my hands
- wired/wireless play, and it charges while wired :D
- easy to clean and keep clean :3

Cons:
- it doesn't connect to my phone :( or am I stupid?
- first connect is a lil weird
- I lose the dongle sometimes, it's small okay?
- the thumb grip feels funny, but that's a me issue.
- no backlight, sucks when you play in the dark >_>

Ultimately: this controller is great for the price. I play Destiny 2...which is a pretty intense game for most controllers. I didnt wanna fork out the $250 for a purple elite controller, or the $60. I do love that it's rechargeable by type C (andriod) and that you can find that just about anywhere to replace the cable if it breaks. I do wish that there was a little slot or something on the back of the controller for the dongle, because it's small and my KW likes to try and eat it. 10/10 I would buy this again, or the updated version since that one is out now. But if you're on a budget, this works great for PC gaming and responds very well when taking down Nezy or the Witness ^_^ it's also really good for NFS Heat, No Man's Sky, Grounded, ect.

785,R4ZZMP75984IS,Better than most high end controllers.,"I've been using an Xbox controller to PC game for a couple of years; if you search online it's the best way to go for quality and price. Two things I couldn't stand about it: the drift and the loud clicking buttons. The clicking...that crackle of hard plastic crashing onto more hard plastic...the worst sound ever conceived if you're a late night gamer with a sleeping baby and Mrs. in the house. A side note: I also tried the PS5 controller, but the battery life was lacking.

I'm so happy I finally found a replacement.
Pros:
This controller doesn't drift.
It feels great in my hands; very similar to a Nintendo Switch Pro controller.
It feels as if it's made of quality materials; not that cheap hollow feel.
I've had no issues with response or feedback.
The buttons feel great with no sticking.
The battery life is amazing.
The sound: the controller is quiet. No more loud clicking of buttons or sticks.
Setup is simple. I'm using windows and I had to re read the instructions because I plugged in the dongle and it did everything for me...I thought I was missing steps!
Turning on and off is really easy; which, by the way, was another complaint of my previous controller. Aside from the quieter buttons, the best part is the price which is much cheaper than the competiton out there.
I usually prefer the color my controllers to mimic the system; I wish there was a black offered during my purchase, but the sea breeze green-looking color is actually quite refreshing.

Cons/Neutral:
No complaints as of yet and it's been a week.
(Neutral) I'll say the rumble feature...I haven't really given it my attention; I own every current system and only the PS5 has really wowed me in the rumble feedback department so I don't pay much attention to it when I'm on my other systems.

I'm not the most fluent in PC gaming and, as a casual gamer, my expectations versus experience may differ from other hardcore gamers but hopefully my review will help someone out there. If it also helps, here are my PC specs:

787,R3CSZAP3EG0L1R,Far better than the $ it costs - a detailed review with feature breakdown,"TL;DR Buzzy haptics and a bit loose bumpers don't outweigh the killer ergonomics, analog triggers, and features for the price. Well worth the money.

I was sick of bluetooth controllers disconnecting so I opted for the wireless USB variety. The controller claims it will also just do straight bluetooth and I have no reason to doubt it.

PROS:
* great ergonomics - feels really natural in the hand, almost GameCube level comfort. The stippled texture under the grips feels really nice. The sharp edge along the bottom is actually really satisfying design.
* battery - I charge it only occasionally. Lasts ages. USB-c.
* USB dongle. Bluetooth sucks (I mean in general, not this controller). I love how reliable it has been with the wireless USB
* analog triggers - feel great. Good weight. Thoughtful design around the housing so they don't accidentally press when you put it down (PS4 controllers)
* color - it's a very nice desaturated lavender. The photos on amazon are a little more saturated than it is in person, but it's still very nice.
* build - all of the important parts feel really solid. The housing is very tight. It has nice weight. I've pounded the buttons, sticks, triggers etc while button-mashing my way through spiderman and it's doing great.

PRICE CONCESSIONS:
* no gyro aim / touchpad / back paddles - but those aren't found even on a lot of first party *cough xbox* controllers.
* sticks aren't Hall Effect - they might get stick drift. Just like every other controller.
* materials - It's plastic. The buttons are very plastic. The sticks are very plastic (but have good grip and weight, no jiggling). The D-pad feels slightly washy (but has nice click), the button labels are this oversized stretched white font that looks not great.

CONS:
* the bumpers - they are a little loose. They're not a deal-breaker, but given the tight tolerances of every other button (especially the great analog triggers) they should be better.
* haptics - the vibration motor is too powerful. Or maybe it's not seated well. When haptics trigger it's very buzzy, if you death grip the controller then it feels like normal haptics but if you're holding it with a normal relaxed grip it's loud.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CSZAP3EG0L1R,Kent Broadbent,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71-1oK6OByL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71HPbN51CnL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71IYn++b6QL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71XKi5J80OL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fzGgvPAHL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71gApfNwuQL._SY88.jpg']",,"Reviewed in the United States on January 10, 2024",True,B0C2V6JLNJ,12 people found this helpful,,,
788,R249QK8RZ0YPOB,Bought 2 years ago.  Still works just fine.,"I mostly use this controller to play games on Steam on a PC.  The pros.  1. Has nice hand feel.  I have smaller hands but I think the size is probably good for many hand sizes.  The controller definitely feels more like a switch controller, which is a little more smoother shaped.
2. Battery life/time.  I turn off vibration and this probably tripped the battery time.  Even after using it regularly for 2 years, it's still holding charge just fine.
3. You can charge while playing if needed.  Some controllers don't do this.
4. Can't run headset from controller.  Though to be fair, I'm pretty sure you can't do this for any PC wireless controller.  And I've not got it to work with an official wired Xbox controller either so.  Not sure it's a valid complaint.
5. The center button illumination isn't too intense. Doesn't blind me or distract when using.  It's just a basic white illumination.  Perfect.
6. Times out and turns off with no activity for 10 min.  Better than a 5 min time out. And it reconnects quickly.
7. The backside is textured.  Easier to grip.
8. Xbox thumb caps fit on joystick. Despite the design looking like a switch controller, switch caps are too small and do not fit.  So fyi.
9. After 2 years it still looks new.  I take good care of it, use a stand, and wipe it down occasionally, but yeah.  It does still look new.  No worn spots.

Cons:  1. can't turn off vibration on the controller itself (I turn off in game or via steam).
2. No battery indicator.  I always have to guess if I think it needs charged or not.  But because the battery life is so long (with vibrate off) I've actually never had it die while I was using it.
3. The plastic is pleasant but not as nice as the soft grip kind that feel a little like silicone.  But those also stain and discolor.  So this one is a mixed pro/con.
4. Occasionally I get drops in connection. It's like the controller just turns off.  I don't think it's from low battery because I just click that center button and it's back on and stays on.  Every time it has disconnected it's been this issue of the controller turning off.  Which makes me think it's not registering activity and going to sleep.  Hard to say.  It's rare.  Probably happens once every 40 hrs of game play though it's been happening more lately (controller is 2 years old now).",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R249QK8RZ0YPOB,Dane'lle,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on March 22, 2024",True,B0C2V3QPN7,15 people found this helpful,,,
789,R1NYJM0F1WNF98,High quality controller,"Though it lacks connectivity to the switch, this serves as an excellent PC gamepad and the 2.4ghz connection is fast, far-reaching and reliable.  The sticks are high quality and though they are traditional joysticks that could be subject to drift it's only if the controller itself is low quality. Drift was hardly an issue on controllers of the past, and hopefully this one holds up.  For being wireless and cheap, it feels relatively premium and works well.

791,R1HIHJ0MX8JHAT,Their best controller yet!,"I've owned some version of most 8bitdo controllers over the course of many years and every time a new model comes out, they improve on it in some way. The last one I was using is the Ultimate Bluetooth Controller for Switch/PC/etc. It was their first (I think) to include hall effect joysticks and has served me well. However, one of my long-standing complaints was that there were no anti-friction rings around the thumbsticks, so the feel was a little rough. I saw this finally had some and wanted to give it a try.

In terms of general form factor, it's more of the same, which is a good thing. The biggest difference is that there are no back buttons on this one; there are still extra buttons, they're just moved up to the top and act as secondary bumpers. I have no issue with this as they are still easy to reach, but if you have smaller hands, that could be a problem. It also means that you are giving your index fingers another button to push instead of using your middle or ring fingers that otherwise don't do anything, but ultimately I see this as a sidegrade, not really an up or downgrade.

A lot of other things have changed, though. This one has clicky bumpers, just like an Xbox controller, anti-friction rings around the (hall effect) thumbsticks that are buttery smooth, and a clicky d-pad, again like an Xbox controller. Except... it's not THAT clicky. It's more similar to their usual rubber dome d-pad, but with a slight click. The best of both worlds, really: the general feel of a rubber dome d-pad, but with the tactile authority and accuracy of a clicky one. I absolutely love it.

The face buttons don't use this mushy/clicky feel, though, probably to save money. They are a bit louder than the other controller but on par with an Xbox controller. I do wish they'd used the same tech as the d-pad, though, as it's really satisfying.

The biggest downgrades are that this does not include, nor is it compatible with, a charging dock. I wish it had the contacts so it was at least compatible, but it's not a huge deal. It also doesn't seem to work with the Ultimate Software, instead having you remap the L4 and R4 buttons on the controller itself. This works fine, but does mean you can't rebind the other buttons. The manual mentions Ultimate Software V2 for firmware updates, but I don't see this software anywhere on the web site, so maybe it's not out yet.

792,R3OY88HGHE07QH,Great Budget PC Controller!,"I wasn't sure at first that buying something cheap would be good, as many budget controllers usually get bad reviews. But this one has been great. Long battery life, excellent connection, and no problems. So far, no stick drift issues. I can play all my games that use the controller. But, I haven't tried these controllers with an android device or see it can be used on a gaming console.

The USB receiver has gotten an update. I hope they'll give more firmware in the future.

Just the fact that the controller can play up to 25 hours is fantastic. It uses a USB charging cable which comes in the box, is wonderful. But you can use your own as well.

What's cool is it has a turbo button that you can when playing martial art games like Street Fighter or playing shoot'em ups.

795,R1YKVGWSCV2MXS,iPad Pro M4 2024,"I chose this for my new iPad Pro 2024 M4. I wasn’t 100% sure when I chose this multiport adapter from KIROSA was going to work with this new device, but everything on the listing indicated that it would. The reason I chose this was twofold. I use a cheap pair of plug-in wired earbuds that fit my old iPad with a 3.5 mm jack. I wanted to be able to use them on my new iPad since at work sometimes I need to get up and run. I pull out my earbuds and throw them on the table. I didn’t want to do that with wireless earbuds. I also wanted a device that would allow me to read full-size and microSD cards to view photos from a hunting camera. In the past, we had had to use a full size laptop to view them.
When I plugged this multi port adapter into my new iPad, it immediately recognized it and everything looked great. Then I plugged my 3.5 mm headphones into the Jack and my iPad popped up and said are these headphones or another device I answered headphones and loaded a video. The audio is actually better than it was on my old iPad with these old wired earbuds
When I put the full sized SD card into the multi port and attached it to my iPad, my iPad started immediately downloading the photos. We were able to stop the download and choose not to keep the file. ( guessing this is an iPad setting ). So the sd card reader works too.

Along with this device, I purchased a 100 Watt PD (USB-C) charger.  Plugged in nicely into the PD port, and now my laptop charges as I work. I have a gaming keyboard connected via the USB-A port, and I have a mouse connected also into the other USB-A port.

What I do understand is that this hub works quite well, though it doesn't offer as many ports as I increasingly find myself needing. A couple more USB-C ports would be welcome instead of the SD/TF ports, and it would be great if both USB-A ports supported 3.0, which is much faster than 2.0. There is no reason to provide a 2.0 port other than to keep the cost down, since they are compatible for devices, except that the device connected to the 2.0 port will be much slower.

The camera is super easy to use, with big buttons that make taking photos a breeze. The built-in memory card is handy, and it’s nice that it’s ready to go right out of the box. My grandkid will love decorating their photos with the cool Bluey-themed frames and stickers. Plus, the little screen is perfect for viewing pictures and videos. One downside is that it requires 3 AA batteries, which I didn’t realize I needed to buy separately.

All in all, this camera seems like a great way for kids to explore their creative side and capture fun moments.

880,R2JUU0Y5B6WGPV,There are four Riddick Movies - But this one can stand by itself,"Spoiler Alert, I'm going to cover a lot of details about this movie. If you don't want to read this then stop now and just watch the movie. It's worth the time and if you like fast paced Sci-Fi you will enjoy this movie.

First and foremost, I love the Vin Diesel character ""Riddick."" But truth be told, if you don't go for this type of Sci-Fi then just watch ""The Chronicles of Riddick (TCOR)."" It is one of my favorite movies. This movie picks up where TCOR left off, with Riddick bored and paranoid after assuming the role of the Grand Marshal. You simply have to watch TCOR in order to get this. He arranges with some of his enemies to take him back to his home world (Furia). But instead, he winds up on ""not furia."" A backstabbing betrayal by the Necromongers leaves him stranded and slightly wounded on this far away hostile planet.

What follows is a great story of adaptation, survival and good old fashion ""I'm the alpha and you would have saved a whole lot of lives and butt-kicking if you had just started with that."" But no, after battling through some really hideous, poisonous and downright scary reptile like monsters and befriending a really cool looking alien dog (the dog steals the show with every appearance) Riddick emerges in to a fairly safe part of the planet with no monsters (as of yet).  He stumbles up on an abandoned relay station and sends out a distress call.

Two different ships of mercs show up to try and hunt him down for the bounty on his head. What happens after that is some really good story telling by whoever made up this story. At this point if you want to find out what takes place in this final installment for the Riddick franchise I suggest you watch the film. This movie will not win any Oscars, but the action, suspense, drama and CG effects are outstanding. There's LOT'S of action and plenty of Riddick slays the bad guys (Heck Riddick slays everybody, good and bad). Some great one liners and Katee Sakhoff and Matt Nable, both deliver great performances. It helps a lot if you are familiar with the earlier works, especially ""Pitch Black"", but if you are not you should still enjoy this film.

The most impressive feature is the modern curvy design. Item comes very well packaged with good quality materials. You will get the charging case, the earbuds, a charging cable, different size sleeves and user’s manual. Using them is straight forward and well described in the user’s manual.

Charging case lid is sturdy and firm. Earbuds snug nicely in place in the charging case and the magnets hold the earbuds in position firmly. Pairing to my cellphone was fast and charging the earbuds was quick.

Earbuds fitted very well in my ear and held up nicely. I did some running and weightlifting with them in my ears and had no issues with them falling down. Earbuds held up in my ear without a problem. The box does come with small, medium, and large size earbud sleeves to fit the needs of your ear. Earbuds come with the medium sleeves already installed which are the ones that fitted perfectly in my ear. Sleeves are soft and adapt to your ear shape well not like other brands that after awhile they start hurting your ear canal. Earbud sleeves close nicely against your ear omitting many outside noises.

I was very impressed with the sound quality. These earbuds sound just like my old more expensive high-end earbuds. Sound quality is snappy yet refined to the delicate audiophiles. I tested a range of music from EDM, Reggaeton, Country, Classical, Pop and Rock. All tracks sounded crisp. I have to say that the sound quality is very well balanced. You get good lows, crisp mids and clear highs. I have tested several earbuds in the $150-200 range that sound like crap by overwhelming lows and highs over mids or by enhancing mids by sacrificing lows and highs.

The sound quality is fine although not too hi-fidelity for serious music listeners, but that is to be expected because of the size and these don’t have silicone earbud coverings.

891,R3MU22HPACNVKT,"Fantastic, affordable, high quality earbuds!","I absolutely love these earbuds. I am so impressed with the quality, especially for such an affordable price. I love the sleek, small design of the case that will fit easily in a pocket or purse. The battery status indicator on the front for the charging case and both earbuds is such a cool feature, so I always know when it's time to charge them up. The earbuds themselves were really comfortable in my ears and have a beautiful, sleek design as well.

I love the button on the back of the earbuds for the controls (play, stop, answer calls etc.) because it is easy to find and use.  Other earbuds that use a touch design have been frustrating for me because when I adjust them in my ears, I wind up doing things I don't mean to, like hanging up on a phone call. So I truly appreciate the design of these earbuds.  They were very easy to connect to my Samsung phone and the quality of the sound is awesome. They sounded great when watching movies, listening to music and talking on the phone.

I recommend these earbuds to anyone looking for a fantastic pair of earbuds at an affordable price.

892,R1XITGEKXG8ZG5,Love the new size of the charger and carry case!,"I had the earlier version of these and they had a large battery.  It was a good design because the large battery could also be used for charging your phone because it had a USB port.  But I digress, let's talk about the new ones!

I have always had problems with trying to keep earbuds IN my ear, they were always falling out.  These seem to be the perfect ergonomics as I haven't dropped one yet.  I gave them a 5 on sound because I use the clunky over-the-head sound canceling ones and there is no way to get that with ear buds.  But the sound of music or TV (Bluetooth to the TV so I don't disturb my hubby) is great!  Clear, crisp and the battery hasn't run out yet.  In fact they came already charged, a nice touch.

Packaging is very nice, would make a nice gift because it isn't in some plastic bag.  The unit comes nicely boxed with a foam insert that is made to fit exactly.

I did have a learning curve... to get them out you have to push sideways a little.  Maybe just my stumbly fingers, but now I know the secret to getting them out easily.

I was impressed by their sleek and modern design. The earbuds fit comfortably in my ears and stayed securely in place.

The sound quality of these earbuds is great. The audio is crystal clear, whether I'm listening to my favorite music or taking calls, the Occiam earbuds deliver an enjoyable experience.

One of the standout features of these earbuds is their impressive battery life. With a single charge, I can enjoy up to 8 hours of continuous playback, which is perfect for long commutes or extended gym sessions. The charging case also provides an additional 40 hours of battery life, ensuring that I never run out of power when I need it the most.

The Occiam wireless earbuds are also incredibly convenient to use. They seamlessly connect to my devices via Bluetooth, and the touch controls on the earbuds allow me to easily adjust the volume without reaching for my phone. The earbuds also have a waterproof rating, making them resistant to sweat and rain, which is ideal for active individuals like myself.

I like how small and low-profile the case is and the earbuds themselves. They feel well-made. The other nice thing about this style is that they allow you to hear your surroundings as well. Sometimes I want to block out sounds around me, and sometimes I want to be able to hear when my wife is saying something to me from the other room while I'm cooking, or hear when a cyclist is about to pass me on a walking path.

919,R2Y55RLJG4R86P,Never Used an Auto Recorder Before,"I never used one of these before, but have a personal need so I grabbed one. First things first, this guy is MUCH smaller than I expected. The recorder is very well made, and since it is magnetic, can be placed in extremely discrete environments. I was able to quickly charge the recorder and easily get it up and running. My initial test was to make sure it didn't crop breaks in natural speech. The sound quality was pretty good, clear enough to understand, but not clean enough to be a true audio source.

937,R3C3EZ2NQNEUJK,Great Quality and Sound,"I purchased these in April 2023 and wanted to give a good review regarding durability and functions. I have used these earbuds daily, talking on the phone, walking, exercising and at work. They are still working and have NOT fallen out of my ear like some of my others. Losing an unsecured earbud while walking or shopping can be annoying and costly.
These GNMN G17 arrived securely boxed pre-charged and ready to use. Included in the package are the earbuds in a black charging case approximately 2 inches wide and less than 4 inches long. They come with a 12-inch USB-C cord for charging, two additional ear tips and a user manual. The user manual has customer service information including a WHATSAPP phone number, web address and an email address. The user manual instructions are simple and so is pairing. There is also instructions in the manual on how to answer and end a call. The earbuds indicate which is for the left and right ears on the case as well as on the earbud. Don’t forget to remove the blue protective film. There is an LED power display on the case showing the percentage of charge. They fit securely over your ear and the bud inside to your desired comfort. They are comfortable for my ears, and I’m not worried about losing an earbud by it falling out of my ear.
I am very surprised at the sound and bass quality. The range outside and indoors is good if you walk away from the device you’re paired to, before it unpairs. These earbuds also operate Mono Mode where you can leave one earbud in the charging case and wear the other and they still function properly. These connect/pair very easily with my Android phone or my apple I-Pad. The earbuds automatically pair with the last device used.
I am pleased with the longevity of the charge. You can also charge these on a charging pad.

938,RI3BD0G9P3LMN,Excellent Choice and Value,"I had the GNMN V7 earbuds for nearly a year but then heard about this new version, these G17s. I was happy with the sound of the original V7s but did not like the lack of an actual button for pause, play, answer a call, etc. I gave up trying to control the old ones.

This new version has a button and I appreciate the improvement. The sound is improved as well, but more noticeable in the lower range. I really like the richness of the sound and their volume.

As with the previous version, I really like that they stay in place with the over-the-ear clip. I run, cycle, and workout with these and they stay in place well. I only wear one when running or cycling, though, because they do block other sounds well and I prefer to hear cars coming from behind me. This new version is a little more angled than the old version, so it takes a little more to get them in place but it’s just something I’ll get used to and again it helps them stay solidly in place.

Battery life is great, as with the previous version. I usually run or cycle for around an hour and wear these while playing podcasts or stream music the entire time. When I’m home I place them in the case to charge them and they’re ready to go for my next workout. I can get several runs/cycles/workouts before needing to charge the case. The other day I was on hold for 2 hours with the IRS using these and never even heard the ‘battery low’ warning on the single charge for a single earbud.

The case is sleek and smooth and I like that the USB charging cable now connects at the back of the case rather than the side like with the old version.

Bluetooth connectivity is simple and reliable. I love that I can use one, add the second, and then put one back with no interruptions in sound. Also, since they can connect independently, you could connect one to a phone and the other to a different phone if you need to listen to 2 different things, or share the second one with a running partner who wants to listen to his/her own music.

I definitely consider these a great value because of the rich sound, long battery life, ease of use, and all of the features you get for the price.

941,R21ZZE0DLL07QG,Best headphones you will find at this price,"DESIGN: I’ll start with the thing that I liked the most, the design of the G17 headphones. The design of these headphones is truly superb, the designers know what the real issues really are with other most expensive headphones (yes, I’m about to throw shade to some famous headphones). I regret a lot buying airpods, I spent well over $100 and could never use them since they were always falling from my ears. I bought them for the gym and never used them, totally money wasted. Is outstanding how these cheap headphones make the airpods look so bad. The lightweight design and the adjustable hooks ensures the G17 headphones stay in place even during intense workout, they are perfect to use during any active exercise. Trust me, I tested these headphones by playing basketball with them on, never dropped.
Additionally, the case that keeps and charges the earbuds is well made. It has a tough and minimalist design making it very easy to store in your person so that you can take them anywhere with you without taking much space. The case also has a great individual displays that lets you know the remaining charge percentage. The case is easy to charge with a very common USB-C cable connection (a very short cable is included).

QUALITY: For the quality of the headphones, I can say that they feel more expensive than the actual price of the product. The sound quality is excellent (I could finally understand what my wife is saying through her extremely cheap phone), and the volume is very dynamic (actually, they can get really loud). To change the volume, is as simple as holding the button on one earbud to turn the volume up while other side turns the volume down. There’s also the option to pause and change the song, they are really easy to use once you get use to them.

CONNECTIVITY: The connection to my iPhone 13 and iPad went smoothly and super easy. Another thing that I liked about this headphone, over the previous one that I had at this price, is that the connection remained stable the entire time I was using them. The old one used to disconnect every 5min whenever I put the phone on my pocket.

I will finish this review by saying that the only thing I would change from these headphones is that I which I would’ve got them earlier.

942,R83TGHN6KRLSW,Excellent Quality Headphones at a Great Price,"I purchased this upgraded product to use for Water Aerobics and Water Zumba.  I listen to different genres of music and sometimes TV and/or movies over the course of the week.  I previously used the V7 version and this version is  far improved in so many ways.

Headphone and Charging base quality:  The headphones, base, and charging cable are all very high quality commensurate with the quality of the V7 version.

Fit:  These headphones have an angle to them that’s has  a far better fit in the ear and around the ear than the V7 and I never feel like they are going to fall out of my ears.

Connectivity:  Connecting and pairing for the first time and every time after that is intuitive and effortless.

Battery Life:  I have been very impressed with the battery life of both the headphones and the charging base.  While I never had issues with the previous version, the battery life on these is longer.  Charging is easy and quick.

Volume and other controls:  The new technology with the raised buttons on these headphones is much improved over the previous version.  The user has much more control over the functions.  With Previous V7 version just touching the headphone to adjust the fit in the ear would increase or lower volume.  This version is easy to navigate all the controls by pressing the buttons.

Sound Quality:  The V7 version had pretty good sound quality with slightly more treble, this new version is a higher quality sound with a little more bass.  Both are good but I prefer the fullness of sound with this newer version.  I also find when listening to TV or movies that the voice quality is clearer and easier to understand.

But I noticed GNMN came out with an updated and improved earbuds the G17.  Since I liked the other model so well, and at such a reasonable price point, I decided to get a pair of these.  The G17 had to win me over because I loved the V7 so much.

Long story short, the G17 came out on top.  Three things I look for in an earbud is comfort and security; sound quality and connectivity.

Comfort and security - Can I wear them 1 hour and will they stay in my ears while I work out?  I have a whole drawer full on earbuds that didn't make that grade.  The G17 hook around your ear and keep the earbud in your ear which helps cancel out all the distracting gym noises (like the guy talking on his cell phone right next to you!!!) Plus you don't even know they are there due to their comfort.  (Side note - they come with different size ear pieces to custom fit your ear.)

Sound quality - Well I also own a pair of Bose noise cancelling earbuds.  Does the G17 sound as good?  No, but it is very close.  The Bose base is a little stronger but they are also 10 more expensive.  Not worth the price difference in my mind.  Plus my Bose earbuds keep falling out of my ear, so they fail the comfort and security test.  The sound of the G17 is very clear.  I listened to a live concert and I thought I was there it was so clear.  Very impressed.

Connectivity -  I give the G17 top ratings this this category.  In my drawer of discarded earbuds, one of the common problems I had with them is they didn't connect well with each other and it was hard or impossible to easily switch devices connected to them.  Just like the V7, the G17 worked perfectly.  Just take them out of the case and they automatically connect to each other.  First time out of the box, they automatically go into pairing mode and I was able to connect to my iPad with no problem.  I wanted to see how easy it would be to connect to my Android phone, so I turned off the Bluetooth on my iPad and turned on the Bluetooth on my phone and immediately the G17 appeared.  All I had to do was pair the earbuds to my phone and I was connected.  Next time out of the charging case, they automatically connect to the last device you have paired with them (in this case my phone).

The case is a little bigger than the V7 but very handy.  I like the digital screen which shows the battery charge of the case and it shows if it is charging the earbuds.

Glad I made the purchase.  My V7 is taking a back seat to the G17, but it is NOT going into my discard drawer.

949,R19FDKGBVWX83B,An Awesome Movie Looks Even Better on Blu-ray!,"The movies I currently have on Blu-ray are Iron Man, Kill Bill, The Dark Knight, and Wall-E, and Kill Bill is the second best in video quality on the list, second only to Wall-E.

Kill Bill was my first Blu-ray purchase (which is funny because the first DVD I bought was my favorite movie at the time, The Matrix, and Kill Bill is my new favorite movie), and I am really impressed with it. Aside from the lack of special features, it's just incredible. The video transfer is a lot better than what the DVDs were at an output of 1080p and the audio is crystal clear at uncompressed, lossless PCM 5.1. I doubled over with shock when I saw the opening scene of the Vernita Green chapter because of how wonderfully vibrant the colors are. It really made me feel like I was back in the theater again, even though my TV is only 40"". If you love Kill Bill, then this is pretty much a must-own. While I don't think you should dump all your DVDs for Blu-ray discs, you should know that there's an appreciable difference in quality if you have the TV for it and the visual qualities of the movie are Blu-ray worthy (like Kill Bill). I know that not many people think there's a difference, but you'd be amazed how quickly you turn into a videophile when you see a movie like this in Blu-ray.

As for the movie itself: the only Tarantino movie better than Kill Bill is Pulp Fiction, but I prefer Kill Bill because it has such an awesome mix of heartfelt moments, great music, over-the-top action scenes, and memorable dialogue. You have to go into Vol. 1 expecting lots of blood and unnecessary violence and appreciate that it's a homage. Vol. 1 is just a lot of fun and the cinematography is always spot-on. Then Vol. 2 comes around and brings you more of the story you may have thought was missing along with a lot of smart lines and even more interesting characters than the first. The two together are a symphony of what I love about cinema. I know that few people share my love of this movie, but I think that it's a movie worth seeing at least once, if not several times.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R19FDKGBVWX83B,Elton Pinto,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/ef5a67fb-38da-4651-b34b-350f4aaaead2._CR62,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on February 9, 2009",True,B0D9238TCL,4 people found this helpful,,,
950,R2P2NMCP3AZIUU,FLAWLESS ! An Artist @ The Peak of His Powers,"This album is a bona fide masterpiece !!! Cave produced a set here that is alternately (and sometimes simultaneously) touching, frightening, seductive and hilarious. Lyrically and musically every note and syllable is dead on the money. This is the penultimate Bad Seeds lineup in that (in the studio anyway as other combinations of players have done so as well live) every member best contributes in a meaningful way to interpreting these brilliant songs. Whether it be delicately finessing a section or pummeling it, Cave seems to conduct the unit as though wielding sledge hammer like a feather. The instrumentation fits the mood(s) perfectly and the band never does more or less with it than is necessary to support the melody. If they had only given us ""Do You Love Me?"", ""Nobody's Baby Now"" and the scintillating, superb ""Red Right Hand"" it would have been more than sufficient but the remaining tracks are excellent as well. The songs are catchy without being commercial, memorable without repetition (except when deliberately employed to illicit tension/discomfort) and emotional without being maudlin. Draped in both ornate and spare arrangements each is a pleasure for the ears. For those of you unfamiliar this is the best place to start when exploring the spectacular and timeless catalog Cave has gifted us.

951,RT0GGLIEVQQRD,Great Movie-Box Set is ok,"Quentin Tarantino is arguably the best film-maker of his generation. His ability and passion to tell stories through film is second to none. ""Kill Bill"" bears witness to Tarantino's love of film by referencing a variety of genres such as blacksploitation, marital arts, anime, spaghetti westerns, and superhero movies. Some might find it easy to dismiss him as merely a movie fan who makes movies about other movies. I argue that he's far more creative than that. He draws upon these genres for inspiration and creates stories that are fresh, intelligently written, and compelling to watch. For example, in the third act of volume 2, Bill, played by the late David Carradine, shoots [Uma Thurman's character] with a dart filled with truth serum forcing her to answer his many questions. While waiting for the serum to take effect, Bill monologues about his fascination with comic books and, in particular, superhero mythology. ""The point emerges"" as Bill compares [Uma Thurman's character's] alter-ego, Arlene Plympton, with Superman's alter-ego, Clark Kent. No one but Tarantino could reference comic books in a film and make the dialogue sound so interesting.

In the realm of cinematography, he ""pulls out all the stops"" using a variety of camera techniques like split-screens, long-shots, and fast close-ups on the eyes. Some of these techniques can be traced backed to Martin Scorsese, one of his biggest influences. Of course, do I even need to mention the music? I believe I can best describe the selection as cooler than Dante's ninth level of hell. ""Kill Bill"", while packed with dozens of exciting ideas, can be enjoyed simply as fun movie viewing which, in my opinion, is a trademark of an excellent director.

The Box Set isn't anything extraordinary. Based on my own copy, all that I can determine is that the Box Set contains the regular DVDs............................. in a display box. Unless you are obsessive over display boxes, you could do just as well to buy the two movies separately either online or at your local movie retail store. I personally enjoy the DVD extras but don't be deceived. The Box Set doesn't contain any additional DVD extras.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RT0GGLIEVQQRD,J. J.

952,R2XOUL4NRL8US0,Great movie but no subtitles??,"I purchased this movie knowing that it is a classic and I just wanted to have it for my personal collection. Unfortunately, many of the reviews on amazon were from many many years ago close to when blue ray was still new. I wanted to leave a review simply so others in my position can get some updated info on it.

Firstly, the movie only has one disc and the disc menu has both movies for you to select once you get to the menu screen. No problem with this at all and it works great. If you are getting this movie you likely already have seen both movies and would also just like to have it on your shelf. The only real complaint I have with this collection is that it had no support for subtitles anywhere which I thought was pretty crazy not to be included.

Outside of that the movie plays the same as the originals and many reviews were spot on. You can definitely tell its an older blue ray title but it still plays great nontheless.

954,R3E9MH85M4TH5F,"""I'm am gonna kill Bill...""","Kill Bill Volume 1 (5 stars out of 5)
This film has become an all-time favorite of mine.  The story is great, and told in a very interesting way.  The characters are great; acting and writing are smashing.  There are a lot of awesome fight scenes.  It is very bloody, but in a stylish way (the sqeamish will hate this).  And even when there is no fighting, it's still a vivid, interesting film.  Altogether, it's awesome.

Kill Bill Volume 2 (5 stars out of 5)
Completing the story and filling in a lot of necessary gaps, this second part of the duology is longer and more dialogue-driven, and with less action (and less blood).  Still, it's interesting.  The characters are still great, the writing/acting is great, and the visual style is still good.  It's practically a necessity after watching the first part.  And it has a jolly good ending.

Both films are very sublime and excellent, and highly reccomended to anybody who likes action and doesn't mind some blood.  The Blu-Rays are of great quality, especially for the second film.  The sound quality is great; the dialogue is clear and well-balanced.  Each movie has a 20-minute making-of featurette.  Volume 1 has a musical performance and a bunch of trailers, and volume 2 has a deleted scene and a musical performance.

Whether or not it is worthy of replacing the DVD is entirely up to you.  I liked the movies enough to go for it, and at the very least, I am pleased with the picture/sound quality.  I'll still want to grab the ""Whole Bloody Affair"" edition (you know, unrated director's cut with shedloads of special features and other crud) whenever it comes out, but considering that it never existed in the first place, I am not one to complain.  Heck, I might even keep this copy, so I have the theatrical cut.  Altogether, I don't agree with the others who complain.

955,R1MVXYKMOQYH5M,"There is something for everyone in ""Kill Bill""","I first heard about this movie several years ago when it was in theaters, but I did not know what it was about until I watched it on TV. This extremely action-packed martial arts flick, directed by Quentin Tarantino, centers on a bride and professional assassin, (played by Uma Thurman), who seeks revenge after Bill, her former martial arts master and boss (played by David Carradine) turns on her and attempts to kill her at her wedding. This movie has something for everyone---the martial arts action of any number of Jackie Chan movies, the covert operations of a James Bond movie, the swashbuckling sword fights found in movies like “Zorro,” “Three Musketeers,” or “The Count of Monte Cristo,” and, in the case of part 2, and the domesticity of any number of romance movies or soap operas. It even has a bit of Anime in part 1, and even dialogue in Japanese and Chinese for those who are into foreign films and the “Kill Bill” franchise has an awesome soundtrack. Not only that, but as a Flamenco fan, I was both pleased and surprised to discover that the soundtrack features music by the famous Spanish gypsy Flamenco duo, Lole y Manuel, which was the absolute icing on the cake. What was funny about that, though, was that the scenes in which Lole y Manuel’s music was used as the soundtrack actually took place in Mexico.

956,RCMUUMRB538IE,I was expecting a bit more in Blu-Ray,"Right off the bat, I'll start by saying that Amazon chose to be ""less than honest"" about this set when I bought it. They showed it as ""NC-17"", and said they ""couldn't verify my information"" when I submitted a correction after having received ""R"" versions.

That said, this set is decent, though I really expected a lot more from Blu-Ray.

The video transfer is incredibly sharp, albeit somewhat oversaturated... so you might want to back down the color on your display. Some will probably say that the saturation is intentional, but having seen this in the theater and on DVD, I'm going to go ahead and disagree.

As far as audio goes, Buena Vista was nice enough to give us uncompressed 5.1, though I'm incredibly disappointed that there was no DTS track, as it was indeed available when this movie was in theaters (so it's not like there would have been a ton of work involved in providing it, or that there wasn't enough space on the disc for it). That said, the uncompressed audio is better than average, though, much like the color, I'm reasonably sure an audio engineer was given instructions along the lines of ""Make it thump more! This is Blu-Ray!"", resulting in some unbalanced effects.

Don't buy this set if you're looking for extras. There really aren't any. You get a couple of songs by the 5,6,7,8's (the band playing at Charlie Brown's place) and some 480p trailers for other Tarantino movies.

If you already own the DVD set and have a decent upscaling DVD player, this Blu-Ray set isn't going to offer you very much more than you already have. But at the price Amazon's offering the set at, it isn't like you're getting ripped off.

It's so quiet! I can barely hear it running, which means no annoying buzz to ruin the mood. Plus, when it's off-duty, it tucks away neatly without hogging space. Overall, I'm pretty chuffed with it.

Battery life is a strong suit; these earbuds hold a charge well and last surprisingly long. I've been using them throughout the day without worrying about running out of power.

When it comes to calls, the clarity is excellent. I've had conversations without any distortion or background noise, making them reliable for both music and calls.

The sleek design and comfortable fit enhance the overall experience, making them suitable for long periods of use. The touch controls are responsive, adding to the user-friendly design.

In terms of portability, the compact charging case is convenient for on-the-go use.

971,R242XSZLM45ZJG,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR THE PRICE,"Just received today and tested, Honestly it much better than the more expensive earbuds I bought. The ones I bought have only one ear size and I couldn't keep them in because they were too big. This earbuds have 3 interchangeable sizes to choose. The design is very comfortable, lightweight and ergonomic, fits well for ears.
If you fit the earphones tightly in your ears, you can enjoy excellent quality bass sound, which allows you to reduce outside noise. Microphone is very good too, when I make a call, the other person hear me strong and clear
Battery life is amazing and the battery charge is very fast too, battery life indicator is very useful, show it the battery charge percentage, this is really excellent because allows me to know how much charge I have. In addition to that, it has two charging systems: Type-C charging and Wireless Charging.
Bluetooth connection is very easy and quickly, GNMN M7 has many functions, which makes it more efficient like answer call, end call, reject call, next track, previous track, play or pause, volume up, volume down for song or videos YouTube, another good function is when you put it in your ears, audio system tells you “Power on, connected”
The headphones have a good range, between my devices and the headphones, I have tested it up to 5 meters away. Material quality is very resistant, I have dropped many times and headphones are ok. I can use only the right headphone on and it works without the need to have both in my ears, so my left ear can be free to be aware of my surroundings
I have connected it to many devices such as my iPhone, Apple TV, Android phone and on my Windows 11 Laptop and it has been compatible with all of them, without any problem, pairing was quickly.

972,R15Y2R3A93JHFV,Fantastic Sound Quality,"The GNMN True Wireless Earbuds are a great choice for anyone looking for stellar sound quality at a reasonable price. These earbuds offer a rich sound when listening to music and podcasts and the design is sleek and compact.

The battery life is very impressive.  I can use them for long periods without the need for frequent recharging, which is extremely convenient and allows me to leave the in the car for long periods.  I also appreciate the fact the case shows the charging status so there is no need to hold the case close to phone and open the lid.  The fit is comfortable they are pretty stable although I did need to change the eartip cover to a smaller one, but that was no problem as they come with three options.  I would say one  drawback for me was they did not stay in my ears well at the gym, but i find most earbuds (even the high end ones) do not.  I primarily use another brand with earhooks . . . but believe me, the sound quality is far better from the GNMN M7s then the sport earbuds I recently purchased.

The touch controls for calls and music work nicely, allowing for easy adjustments to the volume, skipping music tracks, or answering calls with one or two taps. The Bluetooth 5.0 provides for seamless connectivity and they paired easily with my iPhone.

I would highly recommend these earbuds to anyone looking for a reasonably priced great sounding earbud.  You definitely can't go wrong with these  . .  . they would make a great gift or stocking stuffer for anyone, especially that teen who may be inclined to lose small items.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15Y2R3A93JHFV,HarleyGirl,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2023",True,B0D7ZQ1ZLF,6 people found this helpful,,,

974,R2FOINBKS1EDG,Reliable and Budget-Friendly: Earbuds That Deliver on Comfort and Battery Life,"These wireless earbuds are a practical choice for those who prioritize comfort, battery life, and ease of use without breaking the bank. When it comes to comfort, they fit snugly in the ears, providing a secure feel even during more vigorous activities like running or working out. There's no constant need to adjust them or push them back into the ear canal, which is a common issue with some other brands.

Battery life is another strong suit. While not extraordinary, it's more than sufficient for daily use, whether you're commuting, working out, or just lounging around. You won't find yourself constantly reaching for the charger, which is a convenience that should not be underestimated.

Sound quality is good, though not exceptional. It provides a balanced audio experience that should satisfy most users. The bass is present but not overwhelming, and the highs are clear without being piercing. It's a sound profile that works well for a variety of music genres as well as podcasts and phone calls.

Pairing the earbuds with an iPhone is a straightforward process. There are no complicated steps or sequences to follow. Once paired, the connection remains stable, without the frequent dropouts that plague some other wireless options. This reliability in connection is something that can often be overlooked but is crucial for a seamless listening experience.

As for the price, it's competitive. You're getting a well-rounded product that performs reliably in key areas without costing as much as premium models. While they may lack some of the advanced features found in higher-end earbuds, such as active noise cancellation or customizable sound profiles, what they do offer is executed well.

In summary, these earbuds are a sensible choice for those who want a reliable, comfortable, and straightforward audio solution. They won't revolutionize your listening experience, but they will perform consistently well in the areas that matter most: comfort, battery life, sound quality, and ease of use. For the price, they offer good value and are worth considering for everyday use.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FOINBKS1EDG,Brent,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/5ef68245-1062-43ba-85f8-c68c47a57b32._CR0,0,500,500_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on August 28, 2023",True,B0D7ZQ1ZLF,2 people found this helpful,,,

976,R135FP8DMXMD0U,Much better than expected.,"I purchased the GNMN M7 wireless earbuds without knowing very well how I would enjoy the sound. I have a pair of Apple AirPods Pro which I received when I received my iPad Pro for free from my university.  I’m not the biggest fan of either the “stick-type” air pods or the type of earbuds that go into your ear canal. I prefer the earbuds with an ear hook as any other type tends to fall out of my ears and I can never get a perfect fit.

Since I have both the GNMN M7 earbuds and the AirPods Pro, I decided to spend a few hours interchanging both based on the music I was listening to through the Amazon Music app. I also completed some phone calls which each one. What stood out to me first was how crisp and rich the sound was from the GNMN M7 earbuds. I didn’t expect the type of clarity and was pleasantly surprised when I first put them in my ears. The one difference that I noticed is that the bass was not as overwhelming as it is with the AirPods Pro. I’m not big on booming bass. It’s just my preference, and it’s probably also why I was never a fan of my son’s Beats wireless earbuds. For me, excessive bass ruins the music. I prefer to adjust the equalizer in the app I’m using when I want bass-heavy music. It’s a lot simpler than having to constantly adjust the bass in songs.

I also discovered that for whatever reason, the M7s didn’t seem as uncomfortable to me as the AirPods. There is a very slight difference in angle that can be seen from the screenshot, which I think makes the difference for me. It doesn’t seem to be much, but depending on an individual’s ear canal that slight angle can be the difference between a comfortable fit and an uncomfortable fit. The M7s were so clear and comfortable that I wore them for close to 2 hours before I even realized that I had them in my ears.

As far as I could tell, (with the exception of the over-emphasized bass of the AirPods) there was practically no difference between the M7s and the AirPods sound-wise. On paper, the AirPods have active noise cancellation. However, I’m not a very big fan of this with earbuds. The change in frequency when using noise cancellation with earbuds usually makes me feel a little queasy. I prefer the noise cancellation through my over-the-ear headphones on my Bose QC 35. And to be honest, I only use that on planes, or when I’m studying in a library. I like being able to hear a few sounds around me. You never know when hearing sounds around you will really matter.

I detected absolutely no difference in phone calls. I was able to hear the user clearly on both models of earbuds, and my voice was heard clearly on the other end with no static or dropped sounds.

The M7s synced very easily with my phone. There was no pairing button to press. All I had to do was have my phone scan Bluetooth devices, and there was “M7”, waiting to be paired. It really is that effortless. The M7s come with three different sizes of ear tips and a USB-C charging cable. I was also pleasantly surprised to discover that the case works with my wireless charger. In addition, one huge advantage that the M7 charging case has over the AirPod case is that the M7s have an LED display on the charging case that tells you what percent the charge is at. The AirPods have no such display. It is more of a guessing game. To be honest, since I wasn’t the biggest fan of the AirPods “stick-format”, the most I’ve used them have been over the past couple of days. In regards to the price-to-performance ratio, they’ve failed to impress.

The biggest clincher, and the one that stands out the most to me, is that in most markets, the M7s are practically $150 or more, cheaper than the AirPods. In my opinion, paying over $100 for ANY brand of earbuds is one of the biggest tech rip-offs going right now. Who knew that I could get the exact same sound from a $30 pair of GNMN M7 wireless earbuds as I do from the AirPods?

I highly recommend the M7s for the excellent sound quality, the comfort, and the price. For such a good pair of earbuds, this is an incredible deal.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R135FP8DMXMD0U,Derek880,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71BcdIaBsUL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71oJXLfcwFL._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71xIADqXuVL._SY88.jpg']",,"Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2023",True,B0D7ZQ1ZLF,22 people found this helpful,,,

I ordered them today paid $2.99 for same day delivery and just got them they paired extremely well with my iPhone 15 with no issue. I went to Amazon music and play a song for about 2 minutes and I was blown away at how good they sound. The size is perfect to throw inside my crossbody bag and my makeup bag. I live for a good black accessory and these didn’t disappoint. I haven’t made a call due to it’s late but I will in the morning I work for a law firm and I make lots of calls to courts. So I hope the sound for the calls both in and out going calls is a clear and crisp as the music sounded. If you looking for a good pair of wireless earbuds look no far!

979,R1PW7QVQKFT7ID,Simple to use!!,"These are so easy to use! I have tried several pair of wireless earbuds. I have often found them to be confusing! I appreciate the clearly worded User Manual that comes with these earbuds.  I love that the earbuds speak “Connected” when the earbuds are connected to my phone—and  “Disconnected” and “Pairing” at the appropriated times.  I love that I can control the volume with the earbuds. (Some other earbuds that I have tried have not had that capability—You would have to use the volume on your device.) You can also Play or Pause music or skip to the next or previous track using taps on these earbuds. I love that is has the prompt sound (musical note) “Du” when the volume reaches minimum or maximum levels. I love that the spot on the earbuds that you are to tap or press is clearly pictured in the manual AND that it is actually easy to touch/ press. (Some others I have had have been super picky about touching a seemingly tiny spot very specifically or lightly. Or others have a button that seems to need to be pressed rather hard.) Before using these earbuds, I thought that I would not like that I have to tap twice to answer or end a call—I wanted to tap only once. But, since using it, I find that I quite enjoy this feature. Tapping only once can sometimes be too sensitive. Interestingly, there is no command on these earbuds that responds to only tapping once.. .

These are also simple to charge, and hold a charge for a reasonably long length of time. The case is a handy, sleek design with a digital display that the buds are being charged and what percent charged they are. They come with multiple eartips, so you are likely to have the correct fit for you. The sound goes nice and loud and includes instructions to go even louder. I know noise cancellation is important to many—that is a thing for these buds as well. Again, overall, these wireless earbuds are very simple to use.

982,R31KCVR9UGIJ9Y,Does Not Work With All Bands,"(Pic shows final result after modification)

The good:  The bumper fits the watch perfectly, with precision cutouts.  Works perfectly with the included screen protectors, which when combined provide complete protection.  They also look as good as plastic can look.

The bad:  The areas that meet together with the watch band extend slightly past the watch.  This caused me to be unable to use the bumper with the watch bands I purchased, as shown.  I ended up using a dremel to file down the bumper in the four parts shown.  The plastic held up without issue while using the tool on the lowest setting and it appears that the plastic is a solid color, not painted, so it still looks good once I finished filing and buffing it out.

Conclusion:  Consider that there will need to be an extra two millimeters between the edge of the watch and band if you use this product unless you don't mind filing it down to fit.  Otherwise, this is a good value for the quality and number of pieces included.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R31KCVR9UGIJ9Y,Jamie,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bo7QP-MkL._SY88.jpg'],,"Reviewed in the United States on June 26, 2022",True,B0D73N1WKT,5 people found this helpful,,,
983,RP3ZRCM0M6CLO,This watch case looks great - not cheap!,"I really was impressed when I rec'd the product. The fit is perfect for the new Samsung Watch 4 (if you order the correct size) and the matte finish is very rich looking. No way you can does it look like and add on. I ordered a 2 pack by a different maker and they just looked like cheap plastic. There was even a seam from the mold.

There is a video up with the product info that shows exactly how to install the screen protector then case. It was all very easy, and I can pop off the case and switch  without removing the glass. I read other people saying that the cases with built in tempered glass can trap water.

I really wish there was an option to buy all 7 colors rather than 2 sets of 5. The reason I bought the 2 pack was to get the rose gold in addition to the blue and green. BTW - the green I received is the dark forest green that is pictured. Someone got a paler green that I would like to have as well.

986,R2V79TUDU3HBOI,You get what you pay for.,"First off, remember, you aren't paying a lot for this, which is why you're here. The cases are not by any means of high quality. They snap on so easily an amoeba could do it, but they don't fit snugly enough and rattle around on the watch; they WILL fall off if your activity level gives them the encouragement. I mitigated this issue by placing some masking tape around the inside of the case, with some electrical tape for grip, (I won't be using the clear case) to fill up the space and help it fit more snugly. Now it fits great, and I admit the silver color looks nice with a black band, at least until it inevitably wears away.  Second, the screen protector. Whatever anti smudge coating they put on it just sort of ""stopped"" part ways up the screen. As a result, part of the screen cleans off really nicely. The other part? Smudgier than my criminal record. No matter what I do, it isn't going to be come out clean. Alcohol wipes? Lense cleaner? Forget it pal. At first I thought it was just the first screen. 3 screens later, I just accepted it. However, each screen I tried fit PERFECTLY in the case, without a bubble or a lifting edge to be found. Plus, that little suction cup they give you is both adorable AND useful! At the end of the day, I am a happy customer of a low quality product. Do I recommend it?

The protection has been useful in the office and on the farm.  It is attractive and keeps the aluminum bezel and screen free of scratches.

1011,R15KYMBQU1HLZL,"Yes, it can brainwash your child (making this grandfather retire his case)","Idina Menzel gave concerts in Chicago (Ravinia) and Milwaukee (Performing Arts Center), shortly before the appearance of &#34;Frozen.&#34;  I was given a front-row ticket to the Milwaukee concert and was struck, above all, by the numerous young people (college age and slightly older) who were obviously familiar with practically every sung word, eagerly joining Menzel on stage upon being invited to perform numbers from recent Broadway musicals (&#34;Rent,&#34; &#34;Wicked&#34;).  As a jazz fan (and musician) I must admit the music wasn't my &#34;bag&#34; (with the exception of &#34;Avenue Q,&#34; which knocked me out).  To my ears, most popular songs of the past 50 years sounds infinitely inferior to the music of Jerome Kern (&#34;Showboat&#34;), Rodgers and Hammerstein (&#34;Oklahoma&#34;), Gershwin (&#34;Porgy and Bess), Rodgers and Hart (&#34;On Your Toes&#34;), Cole Porter (&#34;Anything Goes&#34;), Bernstein and Sondheim (&#34;West Side Story&#34;)--in terms of structural integrity, melodic inventiveness, lyric wit, and range and depth of emotional expression (perhaps the reason these are the songs that constitute the library that has come to be known as &#34;The Great American Songbook&#34;).

In any case, my opinions were rendered meaningless by the profound effect this movie had on my 3-year-old grand-daughter.  Although I didn't observe much of a response from her at the theater (either during or immediately following the movie), a mere 3 months later she's singing every single note, every word of the score of &#34;Frozen&#34; (I couldn't even tell you the name of the composer-lyricist). Granted, in that time she's had a birthday, but I'm no less impressed.  And it's quite apparent that this &#34;blockbuster&#34; out of the Disney studios is having a similar impact on thousands of other children--of all ages.

The tunes from &#34;Frozen&#34; and, for that matter, most other recent musicals, don't lend themselves to jazz improvisation, but neither does much operatic music.  Only the passage of time will tell us whether this music will endure like Kern's &#34;All the Things You Are&#34; or Johnny Greene's &#34;Body and Soul&#34; or Harold Arlen's &#34;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&#34; (to name just a few examples of &#34;classic&#34; American tunes that are part of an inarguable &#34;canon&#34; of American popular song).  But I'll be far more hesitant about criticizing it.  And even if it eventually sinks into the oblivion of so much pop emphemera, a musical like &#34;Frozen&#34; leads in a musical direction that's considerably more professional and sophisticated than the folk, rock and country music (mostly by guitar-playing singer-songwriters) that has dominated American popular music since the 1960s.

Come to think of it, Menzel exhibited a &#34;Broadway voice&#34; that was not all that unlike Ethel Merman's (minus the vibrato--Ethel was the favorite of the early great composers because of her power and elocution, both essential to Broadway shows before the development of the microphone, which was not even a factor in vocal performances until the late 1920s and the emergence of the creative genius who knew to use it-- Bing Crosby).  Near the beginning of practically any course that I teach--literature, music, and film--I warn my youthful troops (learning is a risky adventure) that they all possess a bias against anything that is perceived as &#34;old,&#34; &#34;past,&#34; &#34;before their time&#34; and that one of their greatest challenges will be to surmount their pre-existing bias in favor of the &#34;modern,&#34; or &#34;contempotrary&#34; for education (which means &#34;moving out&#34; of restrictive confines) to occur.

Education is more about covering epochs of &#34;time&#34; (in teaching linguistics, I endeavor to go back some 50 million years!) than vast expanses of &#34;space.&#34;  Traveling--even in outer space--is of great interest and even a potentially transformative experience for some, yet it's extremely limited compared to the traveling in time that is possible only through the study of texts from the past.  In other words, they'd better be prepared to read, and have an open mind to, a lot of &#34;dead white guys&#34; (not excluding some black ones, like Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington, both of whom produced music that resonates in consciousness with the creative brilliance of a Shakespeare sonnet or a Homeric epic poem).

Already, as a teacher-student, I've no doubt alienated myself from not only some of those &#34;present-bound&#34; youth that occupy my classroom but from of the narrow-minded and rigid Americans on the far right who have condemned &#34;Frozen&#34; as a propaganda piece supporting modern &#34;liberal&#34; notions such as women who can overcome formidable obstacles and attain the kind of powerful automony we like to see in our great national leaders.  We're told that such empowerment of women defies all of the patriarchal examples of the past not to mention the teachings of the Bible and other religious texts.  Moreover, we're told that by showing us two women who are capable of loving, above all, each other, &#34;Frozen&#34; is brainwashing our youth into approving of homosexuals if not becoming one!

Who would have &#34;thunk it&#34;!!  (I confess these ideas never occurred to me until I bagan reading and hearing reports about the controversy stirred up by this movie, which had initially left me largely indifferent and about $50 poorer).  It occurs to me that we can all &#34;learn&#34; from these alarmists as the vert antithesis of a genuine student, with a mind open to learning.  Rather than learning how to interpret a &#34;text&#34; (literary, film, musical, etc.) they're &#34;hardened idealogues&#34; who have become all too well practiced in their habitual litmus tests (i.e. &#34;witch hunts&#34;).  I encourage them all to take a few classes in &#34;higher learning,&#34; for their own good and the communities they attempt to serve.

In the meantime, I'm enjoying my grand-daughter's extended arias-recitatives, lifted from the soundtrack of &#34;Frozen,&#34; and being sung with such joyful abandon and power (&#34;mostly&#34; on pitch) that I can feel my house's foundation moving and witness my cats frozen in trepidation as they cling to their preferred perches in the four-story trees (ordered from Amazon).  It's enough proof for me to conclude my grand-child (who had just recently conquered &#34;the potty&#34;) was, indeed, &#34;liberated,&#34; and at the age of 3!  Who knows where she'll go from here?  I'm simply relieved to know that she won't have limits placed upon her by some perhaps well-intentioned by sadly misinformed hard-liner.  If you wish to learn about music, you might do well to talk to and hang out with a musican. If you want to learn about &#34;morality,&#34; the last person to consult is a &#34;moralist.&#34;",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15KYMBQU1HLZL,Samuel,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/3e5645e4-2b88-461b-9ff6-9349dc588812._CR0,0,385,385_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on April 14, 2014",True,B0D626HRLD,12 people found this helpful,,,
1012,R30A9KNU3RNQYV,A series of happy accidents that conspire to make a superb classic,"Like many adults, when I first saw the trailers for this, I was uninspired. Sure, kids will always like it, it's a Disney thing, how bad could it ever be! However, under the helmsmanship of the brilliantly creative John Lasseter, the film was made, remade, then remade again into a beautiful animated story.
  I am a writer, and although I know story is always king, films are different than books, and in a film you must have other visual and sound elements that make it gripping and appealing. Having read &#34;The Snow Queen&#34; by HCA, I can see why that tale would be hard to make into a good movie - too dark, too dull, too disconnected from the public watching it. &#34;Frozen&#34; gives us somewhat flawed, human characters that have been SO-O carefully written, and SO-O carefully animated by a team of brilliant animators, that, although they don't look precisely like normal humans, they do come alive with a spirit that touches us all. The story is of two sisters, who grew up close and then get somewhat separated - although you'd have to account for them seeing each other sometimes, since they both know WAY too much about the other not to have seen each other at all for some 15 years. Still, they have always loved each other, and both cherish the value of family (witness the true painful sadness at the loss of their parents).  Yet they have a problem with the oldest child having been born with an incredible power that can create ice and snow from the existing atmosphere, manufacture blizzards, and also create several other things (like dresses, ices skates, and living snowmen) from thin air - all and all an awesome power for someone to have.  Now all of this can certainly be fun, but, like all things of power, especially in the hands of a young child, they can also be dangerous, which is precisely what the magical Trolls tell us early on; this provides the monumental difficulty for the two sisters. Thus, because Elsa is just a kid when she discovers this, she has no real ability to control it. Her father's message of &#34;conceal it, don't feel it&#34; is not at all helpful, since she doesn’t practice how to control her powers for all those successive years of growing up; however, the father’s advice is logical to give his precious daughter, trying to keep her, and all those around her, safe.
  When Elsa’s gift is discovered by the community, and she is thought to be a monster - logically enough - she is left with no choice she can think of but to run off and be alone so she won't hurt anyone, and where she can also be herself. There, in the ice and snow wilderness, she discovers all her powers and LETS IT GO! But Anna, who now comes to the crushing realization of what has been happening with her sister all these years, is personally hurt for not understanding before and is still out of a sibling who she loves; and so, she chases after her, picking up the gentlemanly Kristoff and lovable Olaf on the way. The trek Anna and Kristoff make is interesting and truly charming, with some great music and adventure on the way.
  But finding Elsa still doesn't make this an easy rescue, for Elsa is still worried about the damage she can cause since, unbeknownst to her, the fear she can't control within her is destructive; in fact, she thinks of it as a curse. Thus, she chases her sister away to try to save her from harm. In the process, she accidentally strikes Anna with her ice-making power again, this time in the heart, harming her. Kristoff realizes it and knows he has to take her to the magical Trolls, which are his family, to save her. However, after some nice Troll music and another group of charming scenes, the Troll king says he cannot save her, cannot thaw her heart, which only an act of true love can do. And here we have the heart of the story, although the writers sort of err, if in a forgivable way, because that “act of true love” is given several times by Kristoff who takes her to find her sister, and later the Trolls, in the first place and then rushes her back to Arendelle to see Hans who will hopefully save her by thawing her heart with a true love’s kiss - but you don't need more of an act of true love than what Kristoff has already done a few times! BUT, they give you one anyway, when Hans tries to kill Elsa, and Anna risks her own life to save the older sister she has always adored.
  SO, here we are, with two sisters, each of whom loves the other enough to sacrifice herself for her - Elsa, in her lifelong sacrifice of self-imposed solitude, just to keep her sister safe, and Anna, by putting herself in the way of the sword to save Elsa from being slain. Ultimately, it is the quintessential family message of love and sacrifice that saves the sisters, their family, and the kingdom, since Elsa now realizes that love is the way to control her magical power and be a benefit to her kingdom instead of a dangerous curse. This heavy message, so gleefully done, and so brilliantly animated by characters that come alive right before our eyes, with realistic gestures, movements, and expressions, touches our hearts and are what make this film unmatched by any previous Disney animation. The original story idea? TERRIBLE! The dropping of the &#34;Do you want to build a snowman&#34; song - unforgivably stupid; fortunately Lasseter had the common sense to put it back in. Thus, the film they finished with was a spectacular tale of great music, heartfelt pathos, and visual splendor that they are going to have a difficult time repeating in Frozen 2! I mean, the making of the ice castle scene with Elsa singing “Let It Go” (through Idina Menzel’s spectacular voice) is virtually worth the price of the movie all by itself.
  I have one criticism of the marketing of “Frozen” - it is not a story about a young girl searching for her sister trying to restore summer to Arendelle; it IS a story of the Snow Queen, and how Elsa metamorphosizes from a problem child with powerful magic she can’t control to a full grown woman who learns how to control her power for good utilizing her natural love for her sister, and for her kingdom.  That said, there are so many good things about this movie, that everyone should own a copy of it to watch over and over.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30A9KNU3RNQYV,R. V.

1013,R2FZ13I6AUEYCV,Best Disney movie ever!,"I love love love this movie! It's the coolest movie! I love the cast of characters, that the storyline is well versed. It starts out as Anna and Elsa, Anna is normal, Elsa has powers. Anna gets on Elsa's bed, tries to wake her up to go build a snow man. Elsa gets dragged down stairs into Anna's room and then Elsa releases her powers, Anna leaps tall snow hills until she flies and lands on the floor frozen. Her sister Elsa screams for help, her parents carry Anna to the trolls, the troll heals her memory and restores it to a happier time, when her and Elsa were playing. They walk away take Anna home, Elsa is forced to wear &#34; special gloves&#34; and conceal her powers, as the trolls revealed evil would only harm her and others. Her father shut her off from Anna, and she sings to Elsa to come build a snowman. Elsa and Anna grow up, one day Elsa is getting ready to be queen, and Anna wakes up late. So, she throws her dress on does her hair up, and dances around singing. She goes on a ship to arandelle where Elsa awaits her arrival. She meets Hans from the southern isles, he's charming, but, very helpful. She falls in love with him at the coronation of her sister, and when Elsa is crowned &#34; queen&#34; she tells Anna she's happy to see her. Before long Hans and Anna run along singing and Hans asks her to marry him, she says yes. She goes back into the castle, tells Elsa in front of the crowd, Elsa rejects her offer of marriage, and tells her not to go. She says &#34; what have I done wrong?&#34; And pulls off Elsa's glove. Elsa loses control of her powers and used her evil powers instead to create ice that would injure the towns people. They stared in utter shock, and Elsa fled the ocean waters, until it froze solid to north mountain. Anna told Hans she'd go after her, Hans stayed behind to mandate the kingdom. Anna left on her horse, fled to the north mountain to find Elsa. She comes up near the top, no cape on freezing, loses her horse, and is forced to fight the freezing air and snow. She stumbles upon a lodge, enters oakens lodge and asks for a coat and shoes. She's puzzled to see shoes but, no coat. Just then a tall, clumsy man comes into the lodge, he's covered in snow. Anna plays it off, and finds out in the den, it's none other than Sven and Kristoff. She tells Kristoff she has to find Elsa. He says he helps no one, acts stubborn and refusal. Anna persuades him to leave at night, so, they get into his sled, Sven runs faster, and faster, until Kristoff flies off after the wolves, the wolves attack him, Anna throws a blanket on fire at them. She puts Kristoff back in, the get to a cliff, the sled crashes, Kristoff has to be dragged up by Sven and anna. They continue until they find the stairway to where Elsa ice castle is. Once their closer the find Olaf, Elsa's childhood snowman, he scares Anna and Anna throws Olaf around until he's whole again. She puts a carrot on his face wrong, then fixes it. Olaf finds summertime relaxing and sings about it,then Anna and Kristoff move onwards with Sven and Olaf, to the ice castle, Anna and Kristoff find the icy stairway, climb it to the castle with Olaf. She's opening the doorway, Elsa appears after she's built her castle up, the chandelier, and the doorway with balcony. Anna tells her that arandelle is in a deep, deep, winter, that she must break the spell, so, she says she can't, she hits Anna with an icy blast. Anna flees the castle without Elsa. The marshmallow monster throws Olaf, breaks him into pieces.anna gets revenge only to anger marshmallow. He comes after them both and scares them to the cliff, Kristoff repels Anna downwards, marshmallow grabs the rope and Anna cuts it. They fall. Anna lands in the snow, Kristoff sees her hair, and Olaf says &#34; he hesitated&#34;. He says her hair isn't bad. They run to find the love experts, and when they find them, their hiding, and Olaf talks to them. They unroll out as trolls, and welcome Kristoff and later Anna, they try to fix them up, but, Kristoff says &#34; she's engaged&#34;. They try to troll fully we'd them, it doesn't work, so, the grandfather troll told her &#34; only an act of true love can save her&#34; they left, Sven flew thru the woods back to arandelle , dropped her off in the castles door way, she went inside told Hans she needs a &#34; true loves kiss&#34; he was prepared to kiss her, then left her abandoned, he told the king that she died. He lied. She was inside laying on the floor cold and lifeless, Olaf came in lit a match and saved her, until Elsa was captured, broke free, fled the dungeon and then Olaf got Anna out the window, they were trapped! Elsa was walking thru the blizzard, Kristoff was led by Sven to find Anna, Kristoff refused twice, he told Sven to hurry, he almost got to Anna but, by the time he was close, and Hans tried to kill Anna, she stopped hans short and froze solid! Her sister embraced her weeping. She felt her tears and her heart unfroze completely. From then on Anna and Elsa were in separable. Anna gave Kristoff a new sled, and Sven a new title, and then Hans was arrested and the old man was shipped off, Anna and Elsa let winter return after summer was restored in arandelle and ice skated. Anna and Kristoff were happier than ever.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FZ13I6AUEYCV,April Bourne,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/52fb6232-2481-4a15-9f51-aff2133f5e38._CR62,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on March 24, 2014",True,B0D626HRLD,One person found this helpful,,,

1021,R1SFMPDHL6NKYI,Amazing Product all round,"I purchased one camera for the front door as there were some security concerns on our building and we left the apartment unsupervised for long periods of time. It was definitely one of the best purchases I have made.

Pricing is very fair, the 2K resolution works great and allows to view detail while zooming.

The app is free and can hold multiple cameras for free, I believe 4 is the limit but need to make sure. Through the app you can setup motion-detection based recording or chose to record all the time. There you can also speak through the camera, move it around and create default positions/viewing angles to chose from. There are also premium features that require payment, like cloud-based storage and movement follow but the base app is really all you need and works great! You can look at the footage from anywhere.

I have since purchased another to monitor the inside of the apartment and two for my mother's house. Keep in mind you do need to buy SD cards to record locally but those are pretty cheap, around $10 for 64gb here on amazon.

I would definitely recommend these for properties left unsupervised that require supervision (AirBNBs, warehouses, shops, etc)",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SFMPDHL6NKYI,Jose F.,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41dxNIdlMhL._SY88.jpg'],,"Reviewed in the United States on June 25, 2024",True,B09Y8C185M,13 people found this helpful,,,
1022,R2M6YN6N6Y99VW,As advertised and MORE!,"I've been researching security cameras for months but didn't want to pay monthly for someone else to store videos for me. With Tapo you can afford to have the security you need and not worry about having to spend extra each month. These cameras are AM-A-ZING!

Easy to install through their app, connects to wifi seamlessly, has great video quality, and are the best value I have found.

I was skeptical at first but I also purchased micro SD cards for storage. 128mb cards easily store a days worth of video (or more) and can easily be saved to your phone to share, review, or edit.

I could not be happier with my purchase and will be getting more very soon.

I own a small appliance shop and wanted more security for the front entrance. The photo is recorded in 1080p but can be adjusted easily in the app up to 2k.

This is just my 3rd day with these installed and I keep learning more and more exciting features.

Highly recommend!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2M6YN6N6Y99VW,Eric Farley,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71opDPpZl0L._SY88.jpg'],,"Reviewed in the United States on July 20, 2024",True,B09Y8C185M,4 people found this helpful,,,
1023,R21W1NSIJPU2MT,Very Convinient,"While I am aware that this may not be the top-tier camera available, it suits my needs perfectly. It includes audio capabilities and night vision, along with motion detection. The setup process is remarkably quick and straightforward. I was so impressed that I recommended it to a friend, who ended up purchasing two. The array of features is incredibly practical, allowing me to monitor and communicate with my dog while I'm at work.

1024,R23C2H2QFZSKUS,Great Pan/Tilt Motion Tracking Camera but Has Some Issues,"This review is for TP-Link Tapo 2K Pan/Tilt Indoor Security Camera for Baby Monitor, Pet Camera | Motion Detection & Tracking | 2-Way Audio | Cloud & SD Card Storage | Works w/Alexa & Google Home | Black | Tapo C211.
Great video quality in 2K or 1080P but loses some details farther away, which is expected. So while I can zoom in on something, it does lose sharpness if it’s far away. I use it to watch my senior dog when he’s home alone. Setting up the camera is pretty easy by just following the quick setup guide. However, if you have VPN installed on your phone, turn this off first before you proceed or you will have a hard time connecting to the camera and your wi-fi. You can turn the vpn back on afterward. So basically 1) Pause vpn, if applicable 2) connect the phone to the camera wi-fi ID and once that’s connected then 3) connect your phone to your own wi-fi 2.4Ghz network and then 4) resume vpn, if paused earlier. If you don’t turn off vpn you will waste a lot of time trying to figure out why the camera could not connect to your WiFi. Been there done it and this is my 7th Tapo camera setup so just saying…

I like Tapo specifically because I don’t have to buy cloud storage. This means that if you don't buy the cloud service or do not have a microSD, the camera will not record any activity by itself. It will still notify you of the activities you’ve set up to be notified about but it will not be possible to see what had just transpired without a microSD. I personally use a high endurance one that is designed specifically for monitoring cameras and dashcams, not just a phone microSD, because it needs to be able to handle the amount of read-write-retrieve that these cameras require. This is the one I use for all my cameras, if interested: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NY23WBG Just don’t go beyond the 512Gb limit for this camera.

The camera is very good in general but I noticed that it can also lose track of me in terms of motion tracking and pan/tilting especially when I’m wearing dark clothing. After a while it would go back to the original position, leaving me baffled at times. It has also gone offline regularly for no apparent reason so I had to disable motion sensing which took care of that problem but it defeats the purpose of that feature! I thought the unit would rotate in the middle, at the ball joint, but it actually rotates at the base. I can hear it move and I leave the status light on to alert me that it’s on when I’m home so that I can remember to go into privacy mode and turn off the camera. This is usually when I wish that there is a Watch app that I can just click to turn on/off the camera without opening up the whole app to do this. There is a Home/Away mode for this though which can be set up automatically. Everything you need is in the app and I think it’s a great app. They’ve updated it a few times since I’ve been using it and it gets better every time. There’s always something new to play around with and explore. I love being able to download the video to my phone to share with friends and family. The only thing I do find annoying is that it will prompt me regularly every 5 minutes to continue monitoring and I have to respond or the screen is frozen. This defeats the purpose of it being a full fledged monitoring camera so it’s not great for baby monitoring. Something to keep in mind.

Overall, this is a pretty good camera and is feature packed like all my other Tapo cameras but it had some quirks for me like losing track of where I walked and also going offline until I stopped motion sensing completely. It has great night vision and very crisp daylight videos though. It’s just a matter of fine tuning the settings to get things to behave the way you want that can take some time to get right. I don’t like subscribing to anything so the best part is that no subscription is required! I would give it a 4.0/5.0 - 03/11/2024.

Side note: You only need to do the setup on one phone and will be able to view the camera on all your other devices whether iPad or whatever other tablets once you log on to the Tapo app. However, you will -not- be able to view the cameras on your laptop or the web by inputting the ip address in the browser (I’ve tried). Well, I’ve never found a way to do this and I’m not that tech savvy to figure it out but it may be possible using some other authentication method.
Also, you can set the camera to do continuous recording vs only detection recording (Default) by going to Setting - Storage & Recording - Recording Schedule and editing the time blocks from Orange (Only when something is detected)  to Blue (Always record) or even to White (Don’t record anything).
Note that your phone can be connected to the 5GHz wifi all the time but the cameras will only use 2.4GHz by default. Many cameras only support 2.4GHz. As far as I can tell, it will not support or connect to any unsecure wifi network. It seems to only support WPA or WPA2 encryptions. WEP, Portal, WPA/WPA2-enterprise, or WPA3-only networks are not supported.
If your internet drops, you can still use the cameras or watch live views without an internet connection if you are connected to the same wireless network. However, you won’t get any notifications since this requires internet access.
I have the Tp-Link Wifi extender (RE220) and I use the Tapo Tethers app to connect half of my cameras to the hidden SSID (_ext) I set up in the app. I would recommend it if you want to have a greater wifi range.

06/04/2024: Note: If you set up this camera to turn on and off with another camera (like with Leave Home or Arrive Home automation), and you turn on the other camera, this camera will also turn on by itself as soon as you appear in front of it (despite being in Privacy Mode i.e. camera is OFF). I believe this is a serious bug and so don’t be surprised to find the camera has turned on all by itself even if you have privacy set to ON, if you have this type of setup. Otherwise, it will stay shut down in privacy mode. If you don’t want this to happen then do not add this camera to your automation routine. However, this doesn’t just happen with this camera. It happens with all my other Tapo cameras as well that are linked with a motion sensing camera such as this one. For example, if you set Arrive Home to turn OFF both this camera and a non-motion sensing one, and you manually turned on this motion sensing camera, it will also force the other non-motion sensing one to come on as well so be careful with this type of setup lest you find it recording you doing something you may not want to be seen on camera.

1030,R25J8J7SQ4OK0Y,Very nice 360 2K camera but needs a little work still to earn 5 stars,"These are great indoor cameras, don't get me wrong, and I almost gave them 5 stars but... yes there is a but...  you cannot setup the alarm to trigger on only ""Person"" detection unless you disable ""Motion"" detection and if you disable Motion detection then the camera will not track anything and there is no point in have a 360-degree camera if it is not going to automatically track. So that is the only thing currently wrong with the camera which could be easily fixed with a firmware update. With Alarm set it on it would be going off every time a moth flies in front of it or a spider decides to start building its web in front of it... well you get the idea. They need to have it updated so you can set the alarm to go off if ONLY a Person is detected, or ONLY if motion is detected, or you could set it to BOTH should you desire. I live in a part of the world where the doors and window are left open from morning and closed at night so yeah.. there are going to be flying insects and sometimes even birds coming into the house, and we also have a cat so I do not want the alarm going off at 3am if the camera detects motion of any kind but I DO want it to go off it detects a person at 3am that should not be up and about inside the house at that hour.

Other than that one oversight the camera is very good and tracks movements well and video playback from the inserted 32GB card is sharp and detailed. When you pan/tilt the camera, the video does get a bit distorted, but I am sure that is causes by motor electrical noise interference or not enough processing power of the video when the camera is motion. Perhaps they can tweak that a bit to help the video be a bit clearing while pan and tilting the camera with a firmware update. I will of course be updating this review in the future after I see how it continually performs and if they fix the Alarm issue, I will adjust the stars accordingly. I hope this review helps someone on their buying decision.

1033,R160JORB8IT11X,Easy to upload images with app installation,"This Kosshe Digital Interface has an easy to use menu. If you wanted to share the photo frames for use by others in your family, you could go to Settings (purple button on the far right of screen) . Then scroll down below the QR code to User Management, and click the + plus button to add ""Users"" by their email address. They would have to decide what phone or tablet to install their  ""VPhoto"" app.

Options to change the transition effects appear by clicking on any one image and hitting the sprocket icon below.  The transition effect I chose is ""Flip"" but there's about 8 different options to choose from including ""Random"". You can also opt whether or not you want background music on.  You can shift the transition from 5 seconds to multiple other increments of time, all the way up to 1 minute.

For the music, you would have to install an mp3 either via internal storage, TF card, or USB.  When I plug it into my laptop, it shows up as ""MTP"" or ""T-1"" depending on where I'm looking for it.  From my Explorer folders it shows up as ""T-1"" and it tells me I have 5.69 GB of storage total on it internally. I've added a screenshot so you can see all the folders it comes installed with. It seems well organized.

One of the album settings is ""Sleep mode"" which is set by default at 21:00 to 9:00 if you decide to turn it on, but the default is off. You can simply unplug it from the power source if you want to turn it off; there is no battery on the device.

There is a back button in the Top left corner (Arrow Left)  if you ever need to go back to the original menu with all your settings. You may want to turn off ""Captions"" if you don't want details about the time and date stamp, etc on the images.

There's also a randomize function and you can resort the order if you prefer it to be organized in any other way. The default seems to be by time & date stamp.

You can also choose one of three ""Clock Skins"" and when you choose it, the clock will display instead of your photo images, in case you need a change of pace. And then after choosing a skin, it's still possible to change the design yet again with 8 designs by swiping left or right.

Originally I wanted to purchase this as a gift, but I'm glad I have many months to prep it for my parents to give me time to make it my own, too.  I like how the menu interface gives me the current time, date, and weather as well as a few photos in the corner.  I would show my mom where to find the language settings in case she preferred it in Chinese.  She's in a different time zone so I may have to check back in around Christmas to share how it was received.

If the sound of transferring photos is a bit much (it's something like an ice cream truck music mash-up), that can also be turned off in the Album settings> Notification sound. You can transfer about 50 photos max with the app. But the wire transfer from a computer seems to work easily with no particular limitations, aside from max storage capacity. Expect to spend at least 20 minutes learning where all the functions are, and enjoy customizing this thing to your heart's delight.

I also noticed that the images that I transferred via app are in folders under T1>internal storage>Cloud Album> Cloud> and that each transfer is only identifiable by the time stamp in the folder of images you transferred for each upload.  In other words, if you wanted to delete the pictures or identify them specifically to delete them, it would be easier to use the Kosshe Digital interface rather than from your computer, because there's a trashcan icon for each image.  There are no identifiers in the folder under Cloud, and the files don't seem readable from my computer, which I guess means they have transferred with a proprietory format.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R160JORB8IT11X,S.

1050,R2UJLIZ9FEJNOU,"Comodità, prezzo, portatilità al TOP 🔝","Prima di tutto parto con il dire che il mio giudizio si basa principalmente sul prezzo incredibile di questi auricolari:

1) AUDIO:
Decisamente accettabile. Non adatto ad un audiofilo, i bassi sono piuttosto abbondanti e forse esagerati. Ma nell'ascolto generale non ci si rende nemmeno conto. Inoltre se si vuole intervenire sul suono, anche un applicazione di terze parti influisce bene.

2) Indossabilità:
Ottima! Sono estremamente piccoli, comodi e leggeri. Sono presenti i gommini laterali per l'incastro all'interno dell'orecchio, ciò li rende anche adatti allo sport. (Soprattutto anche alla loro certificazione IPX8, per l'impermeabilità)
Ad ogni modo all'interno della scatola sono forniti altri due gommini.

3) Custodia:
La custodia mi ha positivamente colpito, lo schermo frontale si vede bene anche alla luce del sole, inoltre l'andamento della batteria è estremamente preciso e NON va in decine in decine, è corretto bello e preciso.
La custodia è piccolissima, perfettamente tascabile e comoda.

4) Cancellazione del rumore attiva:
Assente.
Anche se i gommini hanno una buona cancellazione del rumore passiva.

5) Batteria:
Custodia 500mAh,
La batteria è più che abbondantemente sufficiente sia per gli auricolari che per la custodia. Difficilmente dovrete preoccuparvi della batteria.
È il punto forte degli auricolari.

6) Applicazione:
Assente.

Nel complesso sono ottimi auricolari SOPRATTUTTO per il prezzo che presentano. Se ne fate un uso poco eccessivo sono ottimi auricolari.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2UJLIZ9FEJNOU,Paolo,"https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/80573da0-d24a-4469-8cc9-8d1f66b3ac18._CR0,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in Italy on December 15, 2023",True,B0D7M5DLSW,,,,
1051,R35JIH3W9UKLDW,Top Kopfhörer auch für Kinderohren.,"Diese Bluetooth-Ohrhörer sind Top! Schon beim ersten Hören war ich von der Klangqualität begeistert, besonders beeindruckt hat mich der kraftvolle Bass, der in dieser Preisklasse seinesgleichen sucht. Die Klangwiedergabe ist klar und ausgewogen, was sowohl beim Musikhören als auch bei Podcasts und Anrufen überzeugt.

Ein weiterer Pluspunkt ist die bemerkenswerte Akkulaufzeit. Selbst bei intensiver sportlicher Aktivität oder langen Outdoor-Abenteuern halten die Ohrhörer problemlos durch. Das praktische Ladeetui ist nicht nur kompakt und stylisch, sondern informiert auch zuverlässig über den aktuellen Ladestand, sodass man stets im Bilde ist, wie viel Energie noch verfügbar ist.

Das Design der Ohrhörer ist ebenfalls gut durchdacht. Mit den bequemen Silikon-Ohrbügeln sitzen sie sicher und komfortabel, auch bei intensiven Bewegungen. Dies macht sie zur idealen Begleitung für sportliche Aktivitäten jeglicher Art. Zudem sind sie wasserdicht, was sie besonders robust und widerstandsfähig gegen Schweiß und Regen macht.

Die Verbindung mit meinem Smartphone war ein Kinderspiel. Binnen weniger Sekunden waren die Ohrhörer gekoppelt, und seitdem hatte ich keinerlei Verbindungsprobleme. Dies erleichtert die Nutzung ungemein und trägt zur hohen Benutzerfreundlichkeit bei.

Alles in allem bin ich von diesen Bluetooth-Ohrhörern absolut überzeugt. Sie bieten eine hervorragende Leistung zu einem unschlagbaren Preis und sind durch ihre durchdachten Features und das ansprechende Design eine klare Kaufempfehlung für alle, die auf der Suche nach zuverlässigen und leistungsstarken Ohrhörern sind.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35JIH3W9UKLDW,Johann P. ,"https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/655bc176-d7e8-4844-92a4-807a5185eb4d._CR0,0,495,495_SX48_.jpg",[],,"Reviewed in Germany on July 1, 2024",True,B0D7M5DLSW,One person found this helpful,,,

1076,R2H4AUK2TR03VQ,Affordable Way To Digitalize Your Childhood Videos,"I wanted a way to digitalize my childhood videos which are all older camcorder and vhs style tapes.
I have so many that I didn't want to spend $16/tape to have someone do it for me. So for the listed price of $16 this was a steal considering I had about 30 old tapes to digitalize.

Silly me forgot that my computer does NOT have a CD slot, so I was a bit scared that I wouldn't be able to install the drivers. But thankfully after plugging in the USB it was able to download the drivers necessary without the CD.

As far as the digital capture itself, you do need a video capture software (which this does not seem to come with... unless the CD I couldn't put in has it? But I doubt it). But I found a free version online and was able to use it with this device to start digitalizing my old tapes.

You are also stuck with the interface/icons/wallpaper (just that one heart image wallpaper) unless you use an SD card and pick a personal photo or image to use instead. It runs a locked down version of Android 9 for MediaTek based devices but with full write protection enabled so there is no way to side load an APK to root or add Google services. If you are ok with just the preloaded apps (nothing wrong with them at all) this is a great little gadget. You can easily access other services via Chrome so you can still use it for things like email and messaging, or doom scrolling random social media sites. The battery lasts all day playing MP3's from the SD card and a few hours if you stream Pandora, etc. BT headphones and earbuds also sync without issue. Overall it is a really nice pocket media player and would also make for a great gift or even a ""starter phone"" type device to see how responsible your kids are before you plop down a few hundred on a real phone.

1085,RWZ68DWFSE4QT,It’s pretty decent for what it is,"So I’ve never had an mp3 player. Back then I always had iPods.
Being 2024, obviously all tech gadgets have changed. I don’t know if you can still get iPods actually. Everything is on our phones now.
But this device serves as a nice way to be disconnected from your phone and just focus on the smaller things.
The preloaded apps on here take up about 14% of the storage I believe. The storage on this device is fairly decent. It has quite a few different options for audiobooks as well which I liked. It also has a library app where you can input your location, address, zip code or any street you input and it will show you the nearest libraries around you, and if you have a library card , it allows you to listen to these books.
Or has a kid friendly setting where you can modify the settings that are appropriate for your kid. Or also has a dimming setting which is easier on the eyes.
Now for why I rated this 3 stars. The device itself is pretty cool. It’s very small and compact so it’s easy to take anywhere with you.
You have to make sure you are connected to either WiFi or some kind of hotspot , otherwise unless you have downloaded some book content and pics, the apps won’t work for you.
The settings for adjusting the time and date is automatically set to a different time zone and they are ALL international time zones.
You will have to manually disconnect from that setting to input the proper time and date.
The volume on this isn’t that high. It does give you a warning when you want to increase the volume of an alert to be careful of high high the volume is.
The touch screen sensitivity is high. You can barely brush the screen and it will open an app that you didn’t intend to, however upon tapping on any app that you intend on using, the speed of which they open, switch pages, make a list of favorites, or inputting anything into the chrome search is pretty slow. It’s like a 5 second pause before an app will open and pull up any content, pics, information, next play list , etc.
it has Apple Music on here, however since this is an mp3 player, you can’t just simply log into your Apple account and all your music will show up. You have to pay for a membership, even if you’re already an Apple product owner with an Apple ID.
That was a deterrent for me since the playback, and general speed of this device is quite slow.
I actually appreciate and enjoy the pandora app on here and the FM radio app.
To listen to anything, you have to USB connect to a speaker or use the provided headphones as the antenna for the FM radio stations.
The power button is on the right side , below the button for volume. Unlike smart phones, you can’t just touch the screen to wake it up and unlock it. You have to press the power button on the side ( short press ), to wake up the screen. As of now, I can’t really grade the battery life on this. It came at 97% charged when I got it and opened it.
Charging cord and earbuds with different sizes silicone buds are provided. So that contributes a little to the whole package of this item.
Overall, I’m not quite sure how often I’d reach for this device as things on my iPhone are much easier and faster to operate and utilize , but if you’re using this for kids, then it’s a great device to have.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWZ68DWFSE4QT,R-Sora Flood,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615G4xs9drL._SY88.jpg'],,"Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2024",False,B0D4Z8DDYB,One person found this helpful,,,
1086,RJSSA0R542BJV,Not just for kids.,"I didn't order this for the kids. I wanted it. I've been leaving my phone in the next room, so I can slow life down, not having to respond ASAP. I want this to listen to music and books. I just received it, so I'm still playing around with it. This is totally new for me. I signed into a couple of my accounts and pushed play. I was VERY glad to find that it had a built-in speaker! Yeah, it might just a little tinny, but I don't have an issue with that. And in a quite house, it's loud enough. It's sitting on the arm of my recliner and I have no issues hearing every word. And I didn't put it at 100%. If I put it in my front pocket, I would be able to hear it while walking around. I didn't want to always wear something in my ear. I may look into a small bluetooth speaker, for the times it's not as quite.
I'm playing music on Amazon right now and the lyrics are scrolling on the screen! How fun is that? I would think any child would love that. I remember wanting to know the words of a new song.
My 5 stars are for all it has to offer, that I have yet to tap into. Nice little player. In my case, helps me relax just listening to music as I go about my day. I like it.

1087,R1V0IC4QWYANI8,A nice mp3 player with the ability to browse the internet,"I'll start off saying this mp3 player was something I had hoped to be able to customize and add apps etc.
I was met with a OS that cannot be modified at all.

With that out of the way, the mp3 player itself functions as nice as any other brand on the market.
Apps load pretty fast, you can read ebooks, watch videos with the chrome app, and even has parental controls for kids! (Very nice)

The chrome app feels a bit...slow, but not crazy slow. There is some noticeable lag while watching some videos on it but its very minimal. (remember this is a budget mp3 player and not a flagship phone)

Battery life is pretty good too unless you leave it playing youtube videos overnight, which I did.
(There is some heat coming from the back where the battery is) This happens with most budget electronics and even some flagship phones so do not worry that much about it unless it gets overly hot.

Overall I am very happy with this mp3 player and will use it on long drives in my truck!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1V0IC4QWYANI8,larry daniel workman,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2024",False,B0D4Z8DDYB,,,,
1088,R3748W4CDLNHJM,"Pretty cool, but...","First, this is great if you don't want any customization. It's a basic mp3 player. Plays music, videos, and photos. A minimum ebook capability. The screen isn't very bright. The video player is very basic. Limited customization and format playing. The FM radio only works with plug-in aux earbuds. It doesn't support installation of additional apps. This means not on the browser, not on the playstore, and not APK, XAPK, or EXE. Once an app is deleted, it's gone forever, unless you factory reset the mp3 player.

That's all the negatives so now for the positives

It really is great for kiddos. I mean, it's basic, but that's what one wants for kids. Not being able to install apps is a huge bonus. In fact, most of the above negatives can be positives if you are getting this for a kid.
The browser works great and youtube, x, and amazon all work on it. The battery life lasts about a full day of music playing (screen off, no wifi,) It will last about 3 hours on straight video.

1090,RU98UNQB0X7SL,Decent little media player,"I ordered this little media player so that I can stream music from on my home speaker. It is very basic and has very, limited apps since it is meant for use by kids, but that shouldn't stop grown ups from wanting one!
It comes pre-installed with Spotify, Pandora, Deezer, Amazon Music, Kindle, and a few other music and audiobook streaming apps, plus Chrome browser. Unfortunately, you can't add any additional apps, which is fine since I plan to only stream from Spotify.

The parental controls are super easy to setup if you plan to let your kids use it. Which allow you to set a usage timer or scheduled timer so that it blocks the use of the device when time is up!

One downside is there is no way of updating the apps should they become outdated and it is hard to tell if the device itself will automatically update, but as long as the version of the apps installed are supported, there is no huge urgency to update them.
Another limitation is that I see no way of changing the theme (icons), and you need to download an image or transfer one from micro-SD card if you want to set a different wallpaper.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RU98UNQB0X7SL,A.,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2024",False,B0D4Z8DDYB,2 people found this helpful,,,
1091,R34MW54CHV3M1I,Very usable for audio books,"Basic android system, but not too much you can do with it. That's okay for me as I only want to play audio books on it, and do not plan to use it online or with other than minimal apps. (In fact, I wiped most of them off as soon as I got it. They all come back again if you do a reset, so they aren't gone for ever if you change your mind.)

Head phones are adequate--a cut above a dollar-store pair. Nothing special, but okay.

The icon theme can not be changed from the kiddie-appealing appearance, but it can be minimized a bit by changing the wallpaper.

Volume at full blast is almost too low to hear without head phones--although it could be heard in a quiet room if it was in a shirt pocket. Any other situation and it would not be audible to most people.

Directions are minimal, so you have to figure it all out pretty much on your own. If you have used Android devices before that shouldn't be too hard.

The FM radio works fine--it comes in clearly.

The main problem for me (and the reason for 4 stars instead of 5) is that the case gets pretty hot above the battery area--which can't be good. The battery life seems reasonable (although the over-heating problem I mentioned may limit its life in the long run).

It's very nice when I'm exercising as I don't need to worry about my earbuds coming off. Second, these earbuds have great sound. I can hear the high notes and the low notes. It comes through crystal clear. Third, these earbuds have a very long charge. This is so helpful as I don't need to recharge them for a long period of time. And when they new to recharge, I can just throw them on my phone charging pad. The case acts as a charger. Not only do the earbuds have a long charge, but they can recharge in the case. I appreciate the charging gauge on the case. This provides quick access to see the level of charge that is present. Then I always know when a recharge may be warranted. The cost is incredible for the functionality and sound of these earbuds. They are just as good with extra added features compared to other expensive brands. I am not sure why someone would pay so much money for other earbuds that don't have all the fesutes that these have. Why pay more for something that is less? I've purchased from this company before. Fortunately, I have not had to use the warranty, but the company has been very responsive in the activation of the promised warranty. I am very happy with the purchase of the earbuds. The shipping time was super fast. It came with its own charging cable. It also has different sized comfortable ear buds to fit different ears.

1100,R3KGV6FIB8Y9GJ,Good value option sport earbuds,"The charging case is streamlined and lighter than I would have expected. The lighted display is helpful, and stays lit for an acceptable amount of time. The charging port is a convenient USB - C and is located on the side so that it doesn’t interfere with opening or closing the lid Some other earbuds with the charging port on the back seem to tend to have the cord come unplugged easily when opening or closing the lid. The headphones themselves stay in place very well.  They are comfortable for me to wear for extended periods of time.  The sound quality is decent.  Very good for the price.  The battery life is also good for the price.  The IPX7 rating for water resistance is very good for sport oriented headphones to wear at the gym or while running.  The controls are intuitive and I had paired them and used most of the functions before ever looking at the manual. I paired only one, and then the other used the same pairing setup, making it possible to use either one or both without having to set a separate pairing profile as with some other buds. It is convenient that the play, pause, and incoming call commands are identical for either the left or the right side.  The only command that is different is the next track on the right and the previous track on the left.  There is also a voice assistant command that is helpful as well, and can be set up to Google, Apple, or Amazon services. The rated battery life seems approximately accurate, as does the case battery life.

Additional color options would be a nice update in the future.  It seems possible to me that the ear hook might be shaped or sized poorly for some people, though it fits me perfectly.  An option to switch that out to another shape or size seems like it might be helpful as well.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3KGV6FIB8Y9GJ,Ray,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/816wKVzNg0L._SY88.jpg'],,"Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2023",True,B0D948J9D3,17 people found this helpful,,,
1101,R11RHP87ZA8AO5,Excellent value,"I wanted to share my experience with these amazing wireless headphones I received. They offer a winning combination of comfort, decent bass, and an incredible battery life that left me truly impressed considering how much they cost.
First, let's talk about comfort. Finding in-ear headphones that fit snugly and comfortably can be a challenge, but these headphones nailed it. With a range of ear tips to choose from, I easily found the perfect fit for my ears. During my daily run, they stayed securely in place, thanks to their lightweight design. Wearing them for extended periods, I barely even noticed they were there.
Now, onto the bass. I must admit, I had doubts about the bass performance of wireless in-ear headphones. However, these headphones pleasantly surprised me. They deliver a decent bass response that adds a nice punch to my music without overpowering other frequencies. Whether I'm grooving to EDM beats or rocking out to heavy guitar riffs, the bass enhances the overall listening experience and brings my favorite tracks to life.
The battery life on these headphones is outstanding. I'm amazed at how long they last on a single charge. I enjoy around 10 hours of continuous playback on average, which is more than enough for my daily music sessions. The quick recharge feature ensures I never have to wait too long to dive back into my groove. Not worrying about running out of battery throughout the day is a game-changer, especially when I'm on the move.
I also appreciate the additional features these headphones offer. The built-in controls allow me to adjust volume, skip tracks, and even answer calls without reaching for my phone. It's incredibly convenient, particularly during workouts. The Bluetooth connectivity is reliable and seamless, ensuring a stable connection with my devices.
Lastly, the build quality of these headphones is impressive. Despite their lightweight construction, they feel sturdy and durable. This gives me confidence that they'll last for a long time. Additionally, the included charging case keeps them powered up, eliminating any concerns about battery life.
To sum it up, these wireless headphones have surpassed my expectations. They provide exceptional comfort, decent bass, and boast an outstanding battery life that keeps me grooving throughout the day. If you're searching for reliable wireless in-ear headphones that check all the right boxes, I highly recommend giving these a try.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11RHP87ZA8AO5,Bobby,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2023",True,B0D948J9D3,33 people found this helpful,,,
1102,R1T5ZS26U36CAO,Long Battery life and Comfortable,"The GNMN Bluetooth headphones are pretty decent headphones. I primarily use them when doing yard work and taking walks around the neighborhood listening to YouTube videos. In comparisons to some of the mid brand names I would say that these are right up there. They've got a plastic build that may cheap but they are very well built.The ear pads are comfortable you could wear them all day without a second thought.

They have a good balance between bass, mids, and highs, making everything from your go-to tracks to the latest movies sound good. The noise cancellation is on the low end compared to big brands.

Pairing is pretty straight forward. The Bluetooth connects so smoothly compared to others. The battery life is legit, offering hours upon hours of playtime, which means less worrying about your next charge and doing more listening. The battery life is extremely long, along with the charging case.

Bottom line, the GNMN Bluetooth headphones are a solid buy. They deliver top-notch sound, comfort, and durability, all wrapped up in a simple design. For those who want a decent long battery life and very decent sound for listening to videos and music, these headphones are a clear winner.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1T5ZS26U36CAO,keith,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/712Rd-gwOnL._SY88.jpg'],,"Reviewed in the United States on March 14, 2024",True,B0D948J9D3,7 people found this helpful,,,
1103,R1TVD8Q8EBKOMZ,Super,"If you could only imagine, my frustration in trying to find the perfect pair of Bluetooth earpieces, you would understand that coming across these things (which has been nothing short of amazing) has been such a relief.

There's lots of different brands to choose from and it's hard to trust which ones you can get accustomed to. Some aren't loud enough. Some don't have enough range. Some are just plain uncomfortable.

I work at a large chain pizza place. Which means loud ovens all day. They hold up to the loudness surrounding you enough to be able to hear your entrainment. Or phone calls, whichever. Phone calls are perfect. No dropping, clear sound. Noise cancelling.. All perfect. It has very good volume. They go 'in' ear. I don't know why some brands are trying to push 'out' ear Bluetooths, where it just sits on the outside of your ear. No. Just no. I can't imagine anyone liking that kind of thing when they won't stay put. It's just weird I'm sorry. These go IN the ear and they stay in!

Speaking of comfort, they are lightweight. The lightest Bluetooth I've ever had. But don't mistake them for being cheap and crappy. Given the cheap price point, don't let that deter you from buying, for fear they will suck. They absolutely don't suck. The price was awesome, a lot cheaper than the other brands I spent my money on. But with the awesome usage of this brand, you get the comfort on point as well. The ear hook is lightweight and very flexible, hassle-free to put on.

Also, the more impressive quality with this, is the range. At work, I go into a walk-in fridge and the door closes while I'm in there arranging stuff occasionally, while my phone is set down somewhere on the outside. It never loses connection. Doesn't even flinch. That's the best thing about these. The range is crazy good. Better than any other brand I've tried. I've even cooked in my kitchen at home while my phone was in my bedroom while I was wearing these and it stays connected and playing whatever I'm listening to. At all times.

Battery life is out of this world. They're fully charged right out of the box. Easy installation. I haven't needed to charge not once since buying them and it's been a week.

It has volume control, answer/end call button or stop/play button, whatever it is. It's awesome. I know I keep saying that, but I'm in love with these. It's just a beautiful pair of Bluetooth earbuds. And my favorite I've owned so far and I have owned a lot in my time. Also, there's a voice prompt for every navigation. A woman sounds off when you are connected and tells you if the volume is at maximum and tells you the number in which someone is calling you if you're not at your phone. Could be great for the visually impaired.

I love these so much💕✌️",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1TVD8Q8EBKOMZ,UltraTopSat,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on July 9, 2023",True,B0D948J9D3,38 people found this helpful,,,

These earbuds have an ergonomic design with soft ear caps that’s comfortable to wear. They have flexible and soft ear hooks that help them stay in your ears even with active movements. The earbuds have a smart touch system that allows you to control your music and answer calls. I especially like the long battery life in these earbuds. Each earbud offers up to 10 hours of listening time on a single charge and the case can charge the earbuds for additional time. The first pairing of the earbuds with my phone was so easy and they automatically connect with subsequent use. These earbuds deliver HD stereo sound with strong bass and clear and bright treble which makes the musical experience more vivid.

1105,R14ROGR7V1LI6I,Great headphones,"I’m always skeptical when it comes to buying headphones because I can never find a pair that fits and ones that I like. I was very impressed with these as I took them out of the packaging. These headphones are slightly bigger than regular wireless headphones that look like AirPods. These fit in my ears better than the other headphones I’ve received from this company. I like the behind the ear support, so they won’t fall out. I was told I have little ears and other wireless headphones don’t stay in my ears. I can lay down, jump around, run and exercise and they’re not going anywhere, these fit great! It’s hard to find a good headphone that you can do basically anything with that won’t cost you an arm and a leg to obtain. I’ve had them for a week now and they’re only at 97% charged. So they hold a pretty good charge in and out of the case. I like the capability to turn the volume up or down with just the swipe around the earbud. The sound is absolutely phenomenal! They cancel out noise very well even at the lowest setting so if you like listening to your music very loudly like I do, don’t expect to hear anything or anyone! The sound quality is amazing! Perfect for flights or when you want to drown someone out that’s talking excessively. It comes with a cute charging case that looks like a mini eyeglass case so very easy to keep up with. I would highly recommend these headphones to anyone looking for a great, reliable and reasonably priced wireless headphones. I wouldn’t spend my money anywhere else.

My only problem is the design of the controls which is different than other brands of earbuds I’ve used.  Specifically, I can’t completely control the volume of the earbuds if I’m only wearing one of the pair; long-press and hold on the left earbud lowers the volume and long-press and hold on the right earbud increases the volume.  And the double-click on either earbud to play/pause seems erratic; sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t; or maybe I don’t have the right cadence for the double-click.  And the amount of force I seem to have to apply to the earbud in order to click bothers the outer portion of my ear.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NAPUPJM0OW0L,Dennis,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on July 22, 2024",True,B0D8BVHZ53,,,,

En cambio en el portátil del trabajo no sufría ese problema.

Investigué y encontré el problema, en mi caso era porque la placa base al ser moderna, los pci estaban configurados en gen4, modifique en la BIOS para que trabajarán en gen3 y desde entonces no se me ha vuelto a desconectar, lo pongo aquí por si a alguien le pasa y le ayuda, ya que veo en los comentarios de estos productos problemas similares.

En cuanto el producto en si está bien, cumple su función, los cables son de un metro y medio y he tenido en mi caso que comprar otros, vendrían un poco más largos pero en general debería servirte.

En mi caso tengo conectado teclado, ratón, el adaptador inalámbrico de los cascos y una webcam y no ha sido necesario utilizar la toma de alimentación externa, funciona todo sin problemas

En cuanto a la función de switch, es un sistema simple, hace lo mismo que si tú desconectaras el teclado a mano de un pc y lo conectarás a otro, no simula una interfaz para que el ordenador crea que el teclado y ratón están conectados por lo que tarda en hacer el cambio lo que tarda en reconocer el ordenador los periféricos de nuevo, lo normal 2-3 segundos, pero es rápido en mi caso no molesta. Si necesitas algo más rápido entonces tiene que ser uno que mantenga en cada ordenador las conexiones pero son mucho más caros ese tipo de sistema, tampoco permite conmutar el switch con atajo de teclado, otros switch al realizar una combinación de teclado cambia el switch al otro dispositivo, en este caso solo se puede cambiar por el boton",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2A3UMRSRWUPX3,Ivan Hurtado Lara,"https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in Spain on August 24, 2023",True,B0D69L9SJV,,,,
1125,R1FDBYJKNBYWPG,Perfekt fürs Home-Office,"Ich habe mir den Hub fürs Home-Office zugelegt, weil mich jedes Mal das Umstecken der 1000 USB Kabel aufgeregt hat. Okay, genau genommen nur 4 aber das reicht auch, zumal die neuen Laptops wieder nur 2 ""normale"" USB-A anschlüsse haben, reicht für Maus und Tastatur, fürs Headset reicht es schon nicht mehr.

Der Hub macht einen erstaunlich qualitativen Eindruck, das Gehäuse scheint aus Metall zu sein, was ihm ein gewisses Gewicht verleiht. Das Gewicht wiederum hält ihn trotz der eingesteckten Kabel einigermaßen am Schreibtisch an seiner Position, was ich sehr positiv finde!
Angesteckt sind eine beleuchtete Tastatur, Funkmaus, Headset und der USB-Hub vom Monitor. Am normalen PC leuchtet die Tastatur, am Laptop nicht - das ist aber ganz klar kein Mangel des Hubs, sondern liegt daran, wieviel der jeweilige USB-Port an Strom liefert, da gibt es deutliche Unterschiede!

These don’t go inside your ears like regular earbuds, so they’re much more comfortable. Even during my hardest workouts, they stay put because of the ear hooks. They’re also lightweight, so I can wear them for hours without any discomfort, which is a big plus compared to my AirPods Pros, especially when I'm running.

The sound is crisp, with clear highs and deep lows, and the open design lets me stay aware of my surroundings. This is super handy when I’m out in NYC.

1171,RXGU2PAC7CJR2,Excellent quality antenna,"I received this NewFoot HD TV antenna, and tested it out. I was very pleased with the amount of channels I was able to get, as well as the excellent picture quality. I've attached pictures showing various channels I received.
They are shown as DTV Air, which is this antenna. I attached a quick video as well.

The antenna comes with a USB connection powered signal amplifier, which has a switch for 30 miles or 60 miles. However, for me, the signal was strong enough without the need for the signal amplifier, so I connected the antenna's coax cable directly to my TV. It's good that the amplifier is included in the box, just in case it's needed.

I currently had an HD flat antenna that goes on a wall. It was limited to only one spot at the top of the wall where it provided a good signal. When I hooked up this NewFoot antenna, I was able to put it in a lot more places and still got an excellent signal. I even put it low to the floor, and it still worked perfectly. That makes it a whole lot easier for mounting choices.

Lastly, I was able to receive 31 channels from the flat antenna. I received 49 channels from this NewFoot antenna. Now I have even more channels to choose from.

The app also has a limited but free cloud storage with the option to purchase more storage and gives the camera more options.

Second this camera is very easy to install the camera as it has a magnetic mount that I really love so you can mount it on a magnetic service using no screws. If you want to mount it to a non-magnetic service then it does come with an adapter that you can use with screws. With the magnetic base, it can be adjusted at any angle.

This camera uses a rechargeable battery that should last for 6 months before you need to recharge it and due to the magnetic camera mount it is easy to remove the camera for charging.

 The picture quality is great due to its 2K HD video and has two-way audio. It includes a 32G SD card for local storage and the color night vision is really nice.  It uses Wi-Fi so no wired connection is needed.

The camera has motion detection with a spotlight and a siren alarm if you desire to setup the camera along with notifications. It is waterproof so it can be used outdoors.

It is really a great camera at a great price. I highly recommend it.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2RE8DVVAQ5152,J. J.

1186,RK88GE6G1OM2N,The best there is... Period,"This review is coming with a heavy heart because Jabra has recently announced they will no longer be making ear buds. This is especially sad because these gen 2s are truly the best ear buds on the market in 2024 by a large margin.
I live in East buds 4-8 hours a day and I have tested all the top buds like the sony xm5, bose qc ultra, technics az80s, sennhiezer twm4s and the jabra elite 10 gen 1s. The Gen 1s were the best overall against all of these... the gen 2 elite 10s are better but no longer an overall better, they are superior or equal to all these other top ear buds in every category. Better sound, ANC, hear through, comfort, fit, feel, app support, features, size, connectivity, reliability, and button controls.
my biggest gripe with the gen 1s were their hear through mode, it needed a lot of help, and it got it. there is a stark difference in hissing noise, volume, and clarity in these new gen 2s and it's like you're not wearing anything now. the ANC of the gen 1s were already just barely shy of QC ultras which were the best despite the bose being unusable due to connectivity glitches. the gen 2s are now equal to or better than QC ultras.
They have full crisp powerful sound you can feel with hard hitting bass and intricate notes, crazy ANC like magically turning the world off, awesome tactile push button controls so you dont have to fiddle with that annoying touch sensor BS on other ear buds, highly customizable and configurable app.
These are the ear buds you want and its not even close. The only other ear bud that might be worth looking into is the sennhiezer TWM4s if you like less powerful but extremely intricate detailed sound in certain types of music like classical perhaps, they offer a bit more minute detail but lack the fullness and power these offer. i prefer to feel the music not just listen so elite 10 gen 2s are it.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RK88GE6G1OM2N,Maximus Joseppi,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png",[],,"Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2024",True,B0D5DLF39S,One person found this helpful,,,

The physical buttons are easy to press and have no pressure if pressing the earbuds inward. I wish the ANC/ambient mode switch could be on press/hold on both earbuds, but it's only a single press for the left.

They connect extremely fast! Bass is not like bose but it's good! Mids are on the same level as bose.  The thing that has been a benefactor for me is the microphone! The microphone is extremely good! They definitely upgraded the microphone. The best thing about these that I had a problem with other earbuds is the music is not dependent of eartips! So if you need to go smaller eartips you don't sacrifice sound, if you have tried a bunch of earbuds you know what I'm talking about!

1227,R30L80XWN3KHH,Basic earbuds that work as expected; I like this item,"Item:  Clipsun store’s Wired Earbuds 2 Pack, Fits All 3.5mm Jack Devices
Price:  $7.20 after vendor 10% discount on 07 24 24

I’d forgotten there were two identical earbud sets in this item. Right after they came in I plugged one of them into my Samsung S9+ and both listened to a ‘music-audio test album’ and thereafter made a phone call. Both were successful and the audio was very acceptable. The cable is a pliable-plastic, not fabric, so I’ll try to treat it with care. I’m hoping with use the cable will relax and lose its ‘slight coiled memory’, remaining straight. I’ve found with even my Samsung OEM earbuds the fiber cable eventually developed knots and bends. Plastic can be more forgiving. Durability, as I've found, is usually the tradeoff.

I’d be remiss if I claimed these were high-fidelity quality earbuds. But given their very low unit price of under $4, and their in-line mic and volume-up.&.down controls, this makes for a really high value item.

1234,R38CPMOAVQB7NN,Super Fast Charging Adapter With Six (6) Ft USB-C Cable,"I got the 45W Super Fast Charger to charge my devices while I travel, which is rather frequent. The main device that I charge is my Galaxy S22 Ultra and having super fast charging is ideal with the amount of usage I get out of my device.

Build
The item comes as two individual items: a Super Fast Charging adapter and a USB-C cable, rated up to 5A. The charge adapter is about 2.05 inches in height and length and 1.18 inches in width, making it compact and easy for traveling. It has 2 prongs on one end and a USB-C port centered on the other. It is light weight and feels solid.

The USB-C charging cable is 6' long which is convenient as the extra length comes in handy depending on my charging situation. At times, I am able to use the device comfortably in bed without worrying about tugging on the cable. A note about the cable being 6', the listing and the packaging calls the cable 5' when it is actually 6'. I had wondered about this prior to making my final decision on the product. Lastly, the USB-C cable is actually firm with an appropriate amount of flexibility where needed.

Usage
I unpacked the adapter and cable and removed each from their wrapping. I plugged the USB-C cable to the adapter then plugged the adapter into the outlet. After which, I plugged the other end of the USB-C cable into my phone and watched it light up. At the time of charge, the charge status stated: 56% and 35 m until full. It was getting charged at Super Fast Charging 2.0. It fully charged my device without issue.

Packaging
The item arrived in a clear and white ziplocked packaging. The clear window showed the contents of the bag. There was a sticker on the clear window that stated 45W Charger & 5ft (though the cable was actually 6ft). The adapter was inside another sealed plastic baggie with the words TRAVEL ADAPTER on it while the USB-C cable had a clear plastic wrap.

Final Thoughts
The charge adapter met my needs as I expected it would. It charged my device in a short amount of time utilizing Super Fast Charging 2.0. I also had the flexibility of movement gained with the 6ft cable. I recommend charge adapter for anyone who may have the need for a super fast charger, especially a Galaxy device.

1262,R2V1BZLRN1WTYZ,Perfection Refined,"An excellent upgrade to an already terrific product. I’ve purchased every CharJen AirPod ear tip replacements they’ve released, going back years now. All of them are a significant improvement over the stock ear tips Apple ships. The differences between each of CharJen’s ear tips is less significant but each iteration has improved on the previous ones and these are no different. I do appreciate that the latest version is white — previously they were black. Sound quality is excellent as usual, and the addition of MicroGrips in these seems to keep them in place better than before. The combination of Memory Foam and MicroGrips keep these way more secure than the stock ear tips, which would regularly fall out during exercise.

If you have Apple’s stock ear tips, definitely grab a pair of these, they are immensely better. If you have an older pair from CharJen, these won’t be a massive upgrade, but ear tips do wear out and should be replaced sooner or later — and these are the best one’s yet.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2V1BZLRN1WTYZ,Steve Grenier,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","['https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61hx7N3M85L._SY88.jpg', 'https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61vL5GwGSDL._SY88.jpg']",,"Reviewed in the United States on July 25, 2024",True,B0D5RHRD2D,,,,

The medium size tips were perfect for my ear canal and I could wear them until the batteries run out without feeling any pain or discomfort.
